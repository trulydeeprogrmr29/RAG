How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word? In the n-gram models of Chapter 3, and in\\nclassical NLP applications, our only representation of a word is as a string of letters,\\nor an index in a vocabulary list. This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG, and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel. You might have seen a version of a joke due originally to semanticist Barbara\\nPartee (Carlson, 1977):\\nQ: What’s the meaning of life?\\nA: LIFE’\\nSurely we can do better than this! After all, we’ll want a model of word meaning\\nto do all sorts of things for us. It should tell us that some words have similar mean-\\nings (cat is similar to dog), others are antonyms (cold is the opposite of hot), some\\nhave positive connotations (happy) while others have negative connotations (sad). It\\nshould represent the fact that the meanings of buy, sell, and pay offer differing per-\\nspectives on the same underlying purchasing event. (If I buy something from you,\\nyou’ve probably sold it to me, and I likely paid you.) More generally, a model of\\nword meaning should allow us to draw inferences to address meaning-related tasks\\nlike question-answering or dialogue.\\nIn this section we summarize some of these desiderata, drawing on results in the\\nlinguistic study of word meaning, which is called lexical semantics; we’ll return to\\nlexical\\nsemantics\\nand expand on this list in Appendix G and Chapter 21.\\nLemmas and Senses\\nLet’s start by looking at how one word (we’ll choose mouse)\\nmight be deﬁned in a dictionary (simpliﬁed from the online dictionary WordNet):\\nmouse (N)\\n1.\\nany of numerous small rodents...\\n2.\\na hand-operated device that controls a cursor...\\nHere the form mouse is the lemma, also called the citation form. The form\\nlemma\\ncitation form\\nmouse would also be the lemma for the word mice; dictionaries don’t have separate\\ndeﬁnitions for inﬂected forms like mice. Similarly sing is the lemma for sing, sang,\\nsung. In many languages the inﬁnitive form is used as the lemma for the verb, so\\nSpanish dormir “to sleep” is the lemma for duermes “you sleep”. The speciﬁc forms\\nsung or carpets or sing or duermes are called wordforms.\\nwordform\\nAs the example above shows, each lemma can have multiple meanings; the\\nlemma mouse can refer to the rodent or the cursor control device. We call each\\nof these aspects of the meaning of mouse a word sense. The fact that lemmas can\\nbe polysemous (have multiple senses) can make interpretation difﬁcult (is some-\\none who searches for “mouse info” looking for a pet or a widget?). Chapter 10\\nand Appendix G will discuss the problem of polysemy, and introduce word sense\\ndisambiguation, the task of determining which sense of a word is being used in a\\nparticular context.\\nSynonymy\\nOne important component of word meaning is the relationship be-\\ntween word senses. For example when one word has a sense whose meaning is'),\n",

Synonyms include such pairs as\\nsynonym\\ncouch/sofa vomit/throw up ﬁlbert/hazelnut car/automobile\\nA more formal deﬁnition of synonymy (between words rather than senses) is that\\ntwo words are synonymous if they are substitutable for one another in any sentence\\nwithout changing the truth conditions of the sentence, the situations in which the\\nsentence would be true.\\nWhile substitutions between some pairs of words like car / automobile or wa-\\nter / H2O are truth preserving, the words are still not identical in meaning. Indeed,\\nprobably no two words are absolutely identical in meaning. One of the fundamental\\ntenets of semantics, called the principle of contrast (Girard 1718, Br´eal 1897, Clark\\nprinciple of\\ncontrast\\n1987), states that a difference in linguistic form is always associated with some dif-\\nference in meaning. For example, the word H2O is used in scientiﬁc contexts and\\nwould be inappropriate in a hiking guide—water would be more appropriate— and\\nthis genre difference is part of the meaning of the word. In practice, the word syn-\\nonym is therefore used to describe a relationship of approximate or rough synonymy.\\nWord Similarity\\nWhile words don’t have many synonyms, most words do have\\nlots of similar words. Cat is not a synonym of dog, but cats and dogs are certainly\\nsimilar words. In moving from synonymy to similarity, it will be useful to shift from\\ntalking about relations between word senses (like synonymy) to relations between\\nwords (like similarity). Dealing with words avoids having to commit to a particular\\nrepresentation of word senses, which will turn out to simplify our task.\\nThe notion of word similarity is very useful in larger semantic tasks. Knowing\\nsimilarity\\nhow similar two words are can help in computing how similar the meaning of two\\nphrases or sentences are, a very important component of tasks like question answer-\\ning, paraphrasing, and summarization. One way of getting values for word similarity\\nis to ask humans to judge how similar one word is to another. A number of datasets\\nhave resulted from such experiments. For example the SimLex-999 dataset (Hill\\net al., 2015) gives values on a scale from 0 to 10, like the examples below, which\\nrange from near-synonyms (vanish, disappear) to pairs that scarcely seem to have\\nanything in common (hole, agreement):\\nvanish\\ndisappear\\n9.8\\nbelief\\nimpression 5.95\\nmuscle bone\\n3.65\\nmodest ﬂexible\\n0.98\\nhole\\nagreement\\n0.3\\nWord Relatedness\\nThe meaning of two words can be related in ways other than\\nsimilarity. One such class of connections is called word relatedness (Budanitsky\\nrelatedness\\nand Hirst, 2006), also traditionally called word association in psychology.\\nassociation\\nConsider the meanings of the words coffee and cup. Coffee is not similar to cup;\\nthey share practically no features (coffee is a plant or a beverage, while a cup is a\\nmanufactured object with a particular shape). But coffee and cup are clearly related;\\nthey are associated by co-participating in an everyday event (the event of drinking\\ncoffee out of a cup). Similarly scalpel and surgeon are not similar but are related\\neventively (a surgeon tends to make use of a scalpel).\\nOne common kind of relatedness between words is if they belong to the same\\nsemantic ﬁeld. A semantic ﬁeld is a set of words which cover a particular semantic\\nsemantic ﬁeld\\ndomain and bear structured relations with each other. For example, words might be'),\n",

Semantic ﬁelds and topic models are\\nvery useful tools for discovering topical structure in documents.\\nIn Appendix G we’ll introduce more relations between senses like hypernymy\\nor IS-A, antonymy (opposites) and meronymy (part-whole relations).\\nConnotation\\nFinally, words have affective meanings or connotations. The word\\nconnotations\\nconnotation has different meanings in different ﬁelds, but here we use it to mean the\\naspects of a word’s meaning that are related to a writer or reader’s emotions, senti-\\nment, opinions, or evaluations. For example some words have positive connotations\\n(wonderful) while others have negative connotations (dreary). Even words whose\\nmeanings are similar in other ways can vary in connotation; consider the difference\\nin connotations between fake, knockoff, forgery, on the one hand, and copy, replica,\\nreproduction on the other, or innocent (positive connotation) and naive (negative\\nconnotation). Some words describe positive evaluation (great, love) and others neg-\\native evaluation (terrible, hate). Positive or negative evaluation language is called\\nsentiment, as we saw in Appendix K, and word sentiment plays a role in impor-\\nsentiment\\ntant tasks like sentiment analysis, stance detection, and applications of NLP to the\\nlanguage of politics and consumer reviews.\\nEarly work on affective meaning (Osgood et al., 1957) found that words varied\\nalong three important dimensions of affective meaning:\\nvalence: the pleasantness of the stimulus\\narousal: the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus\\ndominance: the degree of control exerted by the stimulus\\nThus words like happy or satisﬁed are high on valence, while unhappy or an-\\nnoyed are low on valence. Excited is high on arousal, while calm is low on arousal.\\nControlling is high on dominance, while awed or inﬂuenced are low on dominance.\\nEach word is thus represented by three numbers, corresponding to its value on each\\nof the three dimensions:\\nValence Arousal Dominance\\ncourageous 8.0\\n5.5\\n7.4\\nmusic\\n7.7\\n5.6\\n6.5\\nheartbreak\\n2.5\\n5.7\\n3.6\\ncub\\n6.7\\n4.0\\n4.2\\nOsgood et al. (1957) noticed that in using these 3 numbers to represent the\\nmeaning of a word, the model was representing each word as a point in a three-\\ndimensional space, a vector whose three dimensions corresponded to the word’s\\nrating on the three scales. This revolutionary idea that word meaning could be rep-\\nresented as a point in space (e.g., that part of the meaning of heartbreak can be\\nrepresented as the point [2.5,5.7,3.6]) was the ﬁrst expression of the vector seman-\\ntics models that we introduce next.\\n5.2\\nVector Semantics: The Intuition\\nVector semantics is the standard way to represent word meaning in NLP, helping\\nvector\\nsemantics'),\n",

Their idea was\\nthat two words that occur in very similar distributions (whose neighboring words are\\nsimilar) have similar meanings.\\nFor example, suppose you didn’t know the meaning of the word ongchoi (a re-\\ncent borrowing from Cantonese) but you see it in the following contexts:\\n(5.1) Ongchoi is delicious sauteed with garlic.\\n(5.2) Ongchoi is superb over rice.\\n(5.3) ...ongchoi leaves with salty sauces...\\nAnd suppose that you had seen many of these context words in other contexts:\\n(5.4) ...spinach sauteed with garlic over rice...\\n(5.5) ...chard stems and leaves are delicious...\\n(5.6) ...collard greens and other salty leafy greens\\nThe fact that ongchoi occurs with words like rice and garlic and delicious and\\nsalty, as do words like spinach, chard, and collard greens might suggest that ongchoi\\nis a leafy green similar to these other leafy greens.1 We can implement the same\\nintuition computationally by just counting words in the context of ongchoi.\\nFigure 5.1\\nA two-dimensional (t-SNE) visualization of 200-dimensional word2vec em-\\nbeddings for some words close to the word sweet, showing that words with similar mean-\\nings are nearby in space.

But by representing words as embeddings, a classiﬁer\\ncan assign sentiment as long as it sees some words with similar meanings. And as\\nwe’ll see, vector semantic models like the ones showed in Fig. 5.1 can be learned\\nautomatically from text without supervision.\\nIn this chapter we’ll begin with a simple pedagogical model of embeddings in\\nwhich the meaning of a word is deﬁned by a vector with the counts of nearby words.\\nWe introduce this model as a helpful way to understand the concept of vectors and\\nwhat it means for a vector to be a representation of word meaning, but more sophis-\\nticated variants like the tf-idf model we will introduce in Chapter 11 are important\\nmethods you should understand. We will see that this method results in very long\\nvectors that are sparse, i.e. mostly zeros (since most words simply never occur in the\\ncontext of others). We’ll then introduce the word2vec model family for constructing\\nshort, dense vectors that have even more useful semantic properties.\\nWe’ll also introduce the cosine, the standard way to use embeddings to com-\\npute semantic similarity, between two words, two sentences, or two documents, an\\nimportant tool in practical applications.\\n5.3\\nSimple count-based embeddings\\n“The most important attributes of a vector in 3-space are {Location, Location, Location}”\\nRandall Munroe, the hover from https://xkcd.com/2358/\\nLet’s now introduce the ﬁrst way to compute word vector embeddings. This sim-\\nplest vector model of meaning is based on the co-occurrence matrix, a way of rep-\\nresenting how often words co-occur. We’ll deﬁne a particular kind of co-occurrence\\nmatrix, the word-context matrix, in which each row in the matrix represents a word\\nword-context\\nmatrix\\nin the vocabulary and each column represents how often each other word in the vo-\\ncabulary appears nearby. This matrix is thus of dimensionality |V| × |V| and each\\ncell records the number of times the row (target) word and the column (context)\\nword co-occur nearby in some training corpus.\\nWhat do we mean by ‘nearby’? We could implement various methods, but let’s\\nstart with a very simple one: a context window around the word, let’s say of 4 words\\nto the left and 4 words to the right.

Furthermore let’s\\nassume we only count occurrences in the mini-corpus above.\\nSo before looking at Fig. 5.2, compute by hand the counts for these 3 context\\nwords for the four words cherry, strawberry, digital, and information.\\na\\ncomputer\\npie\\ncherry\\n1\\n0\\n1\\nstrawberry\\n0\\n0\\n2\\ndigital\\n0\\n1\\n0\\ninformation\\n1\\n1\\n0\\nFigure 5.2\\nCo-occurrence vectors for four words with counts from the 4 windows above,\\nshowing just 3 of the potential context word dimensions. The vector for cherry is outlined in\\nred. Note that a real vector would have vastly more dimensions and thus be even sparser.\\nHopefully your count matches what is shown in Fig. 5.2, so that each cell repre-\\nsents the number of times a particular word (deﬁned by the row) occurs in a partic-\\nular context (deﬁned by the word column).\\nEach row, then, is a vector representing a word. To review some basic linear\\nalgebra, a vector is, at heart, just a list or array of numbers. So cherry is represented\\nvector\\nas the list [1,0,1] (the ﬁrst row vector in Fig. 5.2) and information is represented as\\nthe list [1,1,0] (the fourth row vector).\\nA vector space is a collection of vectors, and is characterized by its dimension.\\nvector space\\ndimension\\nVectors in a 3-dimensional vector space have an element for each dimension of the\\nspace. We will loosely refer to a vector in a 3-dimensional space as a 3-dimensional\\nvector, with one element along each dimension. In the example in Fig. 5.2, we’ve\\nchosen to make the document vectors of dimension 3, just so they ﬁt on the page; in\\nreal term-document matrices, the document vectors would have dimensionality |V|,\\nthe vocabulary size.\\nThe ordering of the numbers in a vector space indicates the different dimensions\\non which documents vary. The third dimension for all these vectors corresponds\\nto the number of times pie occurs in the context. The second dimension for all of\\nthem corresponds to the number of times the word computer occurs. Notice that\\nthe vectors for information and digital have the same value (1) for this “computer”\\ndimension.\\nIn reality, we don’t compute word vectors on a single context window. Instead,\\nwe compute them over an entire corpus. Let’s see what some real counts look like.\\nLet’s look at some vectors computed in this way. Fig. 5.3 shows a subset of the\\nword-word co-occurrence matrix for these four words, where, again because it’s\\nimpossible to visualize all |V| possible context words on the page of this textbook,\\nwe show a subset of 6 of the dimensions, with counts computed from the Wikipedia\\ncorpus (Davies, 2015).\\nNote in Fig. 5.3 that the two words cherry and strawberry are more similar to\\neach other (both pie and sugar tend to occur in their window) than they are to other\\nwords like digital; conversely, digital and information are more similar to each other\\nthan, say, to strawberry.\\nWe can think of the vector for a document as a point in |V|-dimensional space;\\nthus the documents in Fig. 5.3 are points in 3-dimensional space.

The raw dot product\\nthus will be higher for frequent words. But this is a problem; we’d like a similarity\\nmetric that tells us how similar two words are regardless of their frequency.\\nWe modify the dot product to normalize for the vector length by dividing the\\ndot product by the lengths of each of the two vectors. This normalized dot product\\nturns out to be the same as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, following\\nfrom the deﬁnition of the dot product between two vectors a and b:\\na·b = |a||b|cosθ\\na·b\\n|a||b| = cosθ\\n(5.9)\\nThe cosine similarity metric between two vectors v and w thus can be computed as:\\ncosine\\ncosine(v,w) = v ·w\\n|v||w| =\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nviwi\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nv2\\ni\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nw2\\ni\\n(5.10)\\nFor some applications we pre-normalize each vector, by dividing it by its length,\\ncreating a unit vector of length 1.

We now introduce a more\\npowerful word representation: embeddings, short dense vectors. Unlike the vectors\\nwe’ve seen so far, embeddings are short, with number of dimensions d ranging from\\n50-1000, rather than the much larger vocabulary size |V|.These d dimensions don’t\\nhave a clear interpretation. And the vectors are dense: instead of vector entries\\nbeing sparse, mostly-zero counts or functions of counts, the values will be real-\\nvalued numbers that can be negative.\\nIt turns out that dense vectors work better in every NLP task than sparse vectors.\\nWhile we don’t completely understand all the reasons for this, we have some intu-\\nitions. Representing words as 300-dimensional dense vectors requires our classiﬁers\\nto learn far fewer weights than if we represented words as 50,000-dimensional vec-\\ntors, and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoid-\\ning overﬁtting. Dense vectors may also do a better job of capturing synonymy.\\nFor example, in a sparse vector representation, dimensions for synonyms like car\\nand automobile dimension are distinct and unrelated; sparse vectors may thus fail\\nto capture the similarity between a word with car as a neighbor and a word with\\nautomobile as a neighbor.\\nIn this section we introduce one method for computing embeddings: skip-gram\\nskip-gram\\nwith negative sampling, sometimes called SGNS. The skip-gram algorithm is one\\nSGNS\\nof two algorithms in a software package called word2vec, and so sometimes the\\nword2vec\\nalgorithm is loosely referred to as word2vec (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al.\\n2013b).

Second, word2vec simpliﬁes the architecture (training a logistic regression\\nclassiﬁer instead of a multi-layer neural network with hidden layers that demand\\nmore sophisticated training algorithms).

An extension of word2vec, fasttext\\nfasttext\\n(Bojanowski et al., 2017), addresses a problem with word2vec as we have presented\\nit so far: it has no good way to deal with unknown words—words that appear in\\na test corpus but were unseen in the training corpus. A related problem is word\\nsparsity, such as in languages with rich morphology, where some of the many forms\\nfor each noun and verb may only occur rarely. Fasttext deals with these problems\\nby using subword models, representing each word as itself plus a bag of constituent\\nn-grams, with special boundary symbols < and > added to each word. For example,\\nwith n = 3 the word where would be represented by the sequence <where> plus the\\ncharacter n-grams:\\n<wh, whe, her, ere, re>\\nThen a skipgram embedding is learned for each constituent n-gram, and the word\\nwhere is represented by the sum of all of the embeddings of its constituent n-grams.\\nUnknown words can then be presented only by the sum of the constituent n-grams.\\nA fasttext open-source library, including pretrained embeddings for 157 languages,\\nis available at https://fasttext.cc.\\nAnother very widely used static embedding model is GloVe (Pennington et al.,\\n2014), short for Global Vectors, because the model is based on capturing global\\ncorpus statistics. GloVe is based on ratios of probabilities from the word-word co-\\noccurrence matrix.\\nIt turns out that dense embeddings like word2vec actually have an elegant math-\\nematical relationship with count-based embeddings, in which word2vec can be seen\\nas implicitly optimizing a function of a count matrix with a particular (PPMI) weight-\\ning (Levy and Goldberg, 2014c).\\n5.6\\nVisualizing Embeddings\\n“I see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two.”\\nThe late economist Martin Shubik\\nVisualizing embeddings is an important goal in helping understand, apply, and\\nimprove these models of word meaning.

Fig. 5.1 showed one such visualization, as does\\nFig. 5.9, using a projection method called t-SNE (van der\\nMaaten and Hinton, 2008).\\n5.7\\nSemantic properties of embeddings\\nIn this section we brieﬂy summarize some of the semantic properties of embeddings\\nthat have been studied.\\nDifferent types of similarity or association:\\nOne parameter of vector semantic\\nmodels that is relevant to both sparse PPMI vectors and dense word2vec vectors is\\nthe size of the context window used to collect counts. This is generally between 1\\nand 10 words on each side of the target word (for a total context of 2-20 words).\\nThe choice depends on the goals of the representation. Shorter context windows\\ntend to lead to representations that are a bit more syntactic, since the information is\\ncoming from immediately nearby words. When the vectors are computed from short\\ncontext windows, the most similar words to a target word w tend to be semantically\\nsimilar words with the same parts of speech. When vectors are computed from long\\ncontext windows, the highest cosine words to a target word w tend to be words that\\nare topically related but not similar.\\nFor example Levy and Goldberg (2014a) showed that using skip-gram with a\\nwindow of ±2, the most similar words to the word Hogwarts (from the Harry Potter\\nseries) were names of other ﬁctional schools: Sunnydale (from Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer) or Evernight (from a vampire series). With a window of ±5, the most similar\\nwords to Hogwarts were other words topically related to the Harry Potter series:\\nDumbledore, Malfoy, and half-blood.\\nIt’s also often useful to distinguish two kinds of similarity or association between\\nwords (Sch¨utze and Pedersen, 1993). Two words have ﬁrst-order co-occurrence\\nﬁrst-order\\nco-occurrence\\n(sometimes called syntagmatic association) if they are typically nearby each other.\\nThus wrote is a ﬁrst-order associate of book or poem. Two words have second-order\\nco-occurrence (sometimes called paradigmatic association) if they have similar\\nsecond-order\\nco-occurrence\\nneighbors. Thus wrote is a second-order associate of words like said or remarked.\\nAnalogy/Relational Similarity:\\nAnother semantic property of embeddings is their\\nability to capture relational meanings. In an important early vector space model of\\ncognition, Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) proposed the parallelogram model\\nparallelogram\\nmodel\\nfor solving simple analogy problems of the form a is to b as a* is to what?. In such\\nproblems, a system is given a problem like apple:tree::grape:?, i.e., apple is to tree\\nas grape is to\\n, and must ﬁll in the word vine. In the parallelogram model, il-\\nlustrated in Fig. 5.8, the vector from the word apple to the word tree (= #   »\\ntree−#       »\\napple)\\nis added to the vector for grape (#        »\\ngrape); the nearest word to that point is returned.\\nIn early work with sparse embeddings, scholars showed that sparse vector mod-\\nels of meaning could solve such analogy problems (Turney and Littman, 2005),\\nbut the parallelogram method received more modern attention because of its suc-\\ncess with word2vec or GloVe vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013c, Levy and Goldberg\\n2014b, Pennington et al. 2014). For example, the result of the expression #     »\\nking −\\n#     »\\nman + #            »\\nwoman is a vector close to #         »\\nqueen. Similarly, #      »\\nParis −#           »\\nFrance + #     »\\nItaly results\\nin a vector that is close to #         »\\nRome. The embedding model thus seems to be extract-'),\n",

For example Fig. 5.10 shows a visualization of changes in meaning in\\nEnglish words over the last two centuries, computed by building separate embedding\\nspaces for each decade from historical corpora like Google n-grams (Lin et al., 2012)\\nand the Corpus of Historical American English (Davies, 2012).\\nFigure 5.10\\nA t-SNE visualization of the semantic change of 3 words in English using\\nword2vec vectors. The modern sense of each word, and the grey context words, are com-\\nputed from the most recent (modern) time-point embedding space. Earlier points are com-\\nputed from earlier historical embedding spaces. The visualizations show the changes in the\\nword gay from meanings related to “cheerful” or “frolicsome” to referring to homosexuality,\\nthe development of the modern “transmission” sense of broadcast from its original sense of\\nsowing seeds, and the pejoration of the word awful as it shifted from meaning “full of awe”\\nto meaning “terrible or appalling” (Hamilton et al., 2016).\\n5.8\\nBias and Embeddings\\nIn addition to their ability to learn word meaning from text, embeddings, alas,\\nalso reproduce the implicit biases and stereotypes that were latent in the text. As\\nthe prior section just showed, embeddings can roughly model relational similar-\\nity: ‘queen’ as the closest word to ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ implies the analogy\\nman:woman::king:queen. But these same embedding analogies also exhibit gender\\nstereotypes. For example Bolukbasi et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the closest occupation\\nto ‘computer programmer’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ in word2vec embeddings trained on\\nnews text is ‘homemaker’, and that the embeddings similarly suggest the analogy\\n‘father’ is to ‘doctor’ as ‘mother’ is to ‘nurse’. This could result in what Crawford\\n(2017) and Blodgett et al. (2020) call an allocational harm, when a system allo-\\nallocational\\nharm\\ncates resources (jobs or credit) unfairly to different groups. For example algorithms\\nthat use embeddings as part of a search for hiring potential programmers or doctors\\nmight thus incorrectly downweight documents with women’s names.\\nIt turns out that embeddings don’t just reﬂect the statistics of their input, but also\\namplify bias; gendered terms become more gendered in embedding space than they\\nbias\\nampliﬁcation\\nwere in the input text statistics (Zhao et al. 2017, Ethayarajh et al. 2019b, Jia et al.\\n2020), and biases are more exaggerated than in actual labor employment statistics\\n(Garg et al., 2018).\\nEmbeddings also encode the implicit associations that are a property of human\\nreasoning. The Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998) measures peo-'),\n",

Caliskan\\net al. (2017) replicated all these ﬁndings of implicit associations using GloVe vectors\\nand cosine similarity instead of human latencies. For example African-American\\nnames like ‘Leroy’ and ‘Shaniqua’ had a higher GloVe cosine with unpleasant words\\nwhile European-American names (‘Brad’, ‘Greg’, ‘Courtney’) had a higher cosine\\nwith pleasant words. These problems with embeddings are an example of a repre-\\nsentational harm (Crawford 2017, Blodgett et al. 2020), which is a harm caused by\\nrepresentational\\nharm\\na system demeaning or even ignoring some social groups. Any embedding-aware al-\\ngorithm that made use of word sentiment could thus exacerbate bias against African\\nAmericans.\\nRecent research focuses on ways to try to remove these kinds of biases, for\\nexample by developing a transformation of the embedding space that removes gen-\\nder stereotypes but preserves deﬁnitional gender (Bolukbasi et al. 2016, Zhao et al.\\n2017) or changing the training procedure (Zhao et al., 2018). However, although\\nthese sorts of debiasing may reduce bias in embeddings, they do not eliminate it\\ndebiasing\\n(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019), and this remains an open problem.\\nHistorical embeddings are also being used to measure biases in the past. Garg\\net al. (2018) used embeddings from historical texts to measure the association be-\\ntween embeddings for occupations and embeddings for names of various ethnici-\\nties or genders (for example the relative cosine similarity of women’s names versus\\nmen’s to occupation words like ‘librarian’ or ‘carpenter’) across the 20th century.\\nThey found that the cosines correlate with the empirical historical percentages of\\nwomen or ethnic groups in those occupations. Historical embeddings also repli-\\ncated old surveys of ethnic stereotypes; the tendency of experimental participants in\\n1933 to associate adjectives like ‘industrious’ or ‘superstitious’ with, e.g., Chinese\\nethnicity, correlates with the cosine between Chinese last names and those adjectives\\nusing embeddings trained on 1930s text. They also were able to document historical\\ngender biases, such as the fact that embeddings for adjectives related to competence\\n(‘smart’, ‘wise’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘resourceful’) had a higher cosine with male than fe-\\nmale words, and showed that this bias has been slowly decreasing since 1960. We\\nreturn in later chapters to this question about the role of bias in natural language\\nprocessing.\\n5.9\\nEvaluating Vector Models\\nThe most important evaluation metric for vector models is extrinsic evaluation on\\ntasks, i.e., using vectors in an NLP task and seeing whether this improves perfor-\\nmance over some other model.\\n3\\nRoughly speaking, if humans associate ‘ﬂowers’ with ‘pleasantness’ and ‘insects’ with ‘unpleasant-\\nness’, when they are instructed to push a green button for ‘ﬂowers’ (daisy, iris, lilac) and ‘pleasant words’\\n(love, laughter, pleasure) and a red button for ‘insects’ (ﬂea, spider, mosquito) and ‘unpleasant words’\\n(abuse, hatred, ugly) they are faster than in an incongruous condition where they push a red button for\\n‘ﬂowers’ and ‘unpleasant words’ and a green button for ‘insects’ and ‘pleasant words’.'),\n",

The most common metric\\nis to test their performance on similarity, computing the correlation between an\\nalgorithm’s word similarity scores and word similarity ratings assigned by humans.\\nWordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) is a commonly used set of ratings from 0\\nto 10 for 353 noun pairs; for example (plane, car) had an average score of 5.77.\\nSimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015) is a more complex dataset that quantiﬁes similarity\\n(cup, mug) rather than relatedness (cup, coffee), and includes concrete and abstract\\nadjective, noun and verb pairs. The TOEFL dataset is a set of 80 questions, each\\nconsisting of a target word with 4 additional word choices; the task is to choose\\nwhich is the correct synonym, as in the example: Levied is closest in meaning to:\\nimposed, believed, requested, correlated (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). All of these\\ndatasets present words without context.\\nSlightly more realistic are intrinsic similarity tasks that include context. The\\nStanford Contextual Word Similarity (SCWS) dataset (Huang et al., 2012) and the\\nWord-in-Context (WiC) dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) offer richer\\nevaluation scenarios. SCWS gives human judgments on 2,003 pairs of words in\\ntheir sentential context, while WiC gives target words in two sentential contexts that\\nare either in the same or different senses; see Appendix G. The semantic textual\\nsimilarity task (Agirre et al. 2012, Agirre et al. 2015) evaluates the performance of\\nsentence-level similarity algorithms, consisting of a set of pairs of sentences, each\\npair with human-labeled similarity scores.\\nAnother task used for evaluation is the analogy task, discussed on page 17, where\\nthe system has to solve problems of the form a is to b as a* is to b*, given a, b, and a*\\nand having to ﬁnd b* (Turney and Littman, 2005). A number of sets of tuples have\\nbeen created for this task (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al. 2013c, Gladkova\\net al. 2016), covering morphology (city:cities::child:children), lexicographic rela-\\ntions (leg:table::spout:teapot) and encyclopedia relations (Beijing:China::Dublin:Ireland),\\nsome drawing from the SemEval-2012 Task 2 dataset of 79 different relations (Jur-\\ngens et al., 2012).\\nAll embedding algorithms suffer from inherent variability. For example because\\nof randomness in the initialization and the random negative sampling, algorithms\\nlike word2vec may produce different results even from the same dataset, and in-\\ndividual documents in a collection may strongly impact the resulting embeddings\\n(Tian et al. 2016, Hellrich and Hahn 2016, Antoniak and Mimno 2018). When em-\\nbeddings are used to study word associations in particular corpora, therefore, it is\\nbest practice to train multiple embeddings with bootstrap sampling over documents\\nand average the results (Antoniak and Mimno, 2018).\\n5.10\\nSummary\\n• In vector semantics, a word is modeled as a vector—a point in high-dimensional\\nspace, also called an embedding. In this chapter we focus on static embed-\\ndings, where each word is mapped to a ﬁxed embedding.\\n• Vector semantic models fall into two classes: sparse and dense. In sparse\\nmodels each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary V and cells\\nare functions of co-occurrence counts. The word-context or term-term ma-\\ntrix has a row for each (target) word in the vocabulary and a column for each\\ncontext term in the vocabulary.'),\n",

Word2vec al-\\ngorithms like skip-gram are a popular way to compute dense embeddings.\\nSkip-gram trains a logistic regression classiﬁer to compute the probability that\\ntwo words are ‘likely to occur nearby in text’. This probability is computed\\nfrom the dot product between the embeddings for the two words.\\n• Skip-gram uses stochastic gradient descent to train the classiﬁer, by learning\\nembeddings that have a high dot product with embeddings of words that occur\\nnearby and a low dot product with noise words.\\n• Other important embedding algorithms include GloVe, a method based on\\nratios of word co-occurrence probabilities.\\n• Whether using sparse or dense vectors, word and document similarities are\\ncomputed by some function of the dot product between vectors. The cosine\\nof two vectors—a normalized dot product—is the most popular such metric.\\nHistorical Notes\\nThe idea of vector semantics arose out of research in the 1950s in three distinct\\nﬁelds: linguistics, psychology, and computer science, each of which contributed a\\nfundamental aspect of the model.\\nThe idea that meaning is related to the distribution of words in context was\\nwidespread in linguistic theory of the 1950s, among distributionalists like Zellig\\nHarris, Martin Joos, and J. R. Firth, and semioticians like Thomas Sebeok. As Joos\\n(1950) put it,\\nthe linguist’s “meaning” of a morpheme. . . is by deﬁnition the set of conditional\\nprobabilities of its occurrence in context with all other morphemes.\\nThe idea that the meaning of a word might be modeled as a point in a multi-\\ndimensional semantic space came from psychologists like Charles E. Osgood, who\\nhad been studying how people responded to the meaning of words by assigning val-\\nues along scales like happy/sad or hard/soft. Osgood et al. (1957) proposed that the\\nmeaning of a word in general could be modeled as a point in a multidimensional\\nEuclidean space, and that the similarity of meaning between two words could be\\nmodeled as the distance between these points in the space.\\nA ﬁnal intellectual source in the 1950s and early 1960s was the ﬁeld then called\\nmechanical indexing, now known as information retrieval. In what became known\\nmechanical\\nindexing\\nas the vector space model for information retrieval (Salton 1971, Sparck Jones\\n1986), researchers demonstrated new ways to deﬁne the meaning of words in terms\\nof vectors (Switzer, 1965), and reﬁned methods for word similarity based on mea-\\nsures of statistical association between words like mutual information (Giuliano,\\n1965) and idf (Sparck Jones, 1972), and showed that the meaning of documents\\ncould be represented in the same vector spaces used for words. Around the same\\ntime, (Cordier, 1965) showed that factor analysis of word association probabilities\\ncould be used to form dense vector representations of words.\\nSome of the philosophical underpinning of the distributional way of thinking\\ncame from the late writings of the philosopher Wittgenstein, who was skeptical of\\nthe possibility of building a completely formal theory of meaning deﬁnitions for\\neach word. Wittgenstein suggested instead that “the meaning of a word is its use in\\nthe language” (Wittgenstein, 1953, PI 43). That is, instead of using some logical lan-\\nguage to deﬁne each word, or drawing on denotations or truth values, Wittgenstein’s'),\n",

By the middle of the 20th century, beginning with the work of\\nHjelmslev (Hjelmslev, 1969) (originally 1943) and ﬂeshed out in early models of\\ngenerative grammar (Katz and Fodor, 1963), the idea arose of representing mean-\\ning with semantic features, symbols that represent some sort of primitive meaning.\\nsemantic\\nfeature\\nFor example words like hen, rooster, or chick, have something in common (they all\\ndescribe chickens) and something different (their age and sex), representable as:\\nhen\\n+female, +chicken, +adult\\nrooster -female, +chicken, +adult\\nchick\\n+chicken, -adult\\nThe dimensions used by vector models of meaning to deﬁne words, however, are\\nonly abstractly related to this idea of a small ﬁxed number of hand-built dimensions.\\nNonetheless, there has been some attempt to show that certain dimensions of em-\\nbedding models do contribute some speciﬁc compositional aspect of meaning like\\nthese early semantic features.\\nThe use of dense vectors to model word meaning, and indeed the term embed-\\nding, grew out of the latent semantic indexing (LSI) model (Deerwester et al.,\\n1988) recast as LSA (latent semantic analysis) (Deerwester et al., 1990). In LSA\\nsingular value decomposition—SVD— is applied to a term-document matrix (each\\nSVD\\ncell weighted by log frequency and normalized by entropy), and then the ﬁrst 300\\ndimensions are used as the LSA embedding. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\\nis a method for ﬁnding the most important dimensions of a data set, those dimen-\\nsions along which the data varies the most. LSA was then quickly widely applied:\\nas a cognitive model (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and for tasks like spell checking\\n(Jones and Martin, 1997), language modeling (Bellegarda 1997, Coccaro and Ju-\\nrafsky 1998, Bellegarda 2000), morphology induction (Schone and Jurafsky 2000,\\nSchone and Jurafsky 2001b), multiword expressions (MWEs) (Schone and Jurafsky,\\n2001a), and essay grading (Rehder et al., 1998). Related models were simultane-\\nously developed and applied to word sense disambiguation by Sch¨utze (1992). LSA\\nalso led to the earliest use of embeddings to represent words in a probabilistic clas-\\nsiﬁer, in the logistic regression document router of Sch¨utze et al. (1995). The idea of\\nSVD on the term-term matrix (rather than the term-document matrix) as a model of\\nmeaning for NLP was proposed soon after LSA by Sch¨utze (1992). Sch¨utze applied\\nthe low-rank (97-dimensional) embeddings produced by SVD to the task of word\\nsense disambiguation, analyzed the resulting semantic space, and also suggested\\npossible techniques like dropping high-order dimensions. See Sch¨utze (1997).\\nA number of alternative matrix models followed on from the early SVD work,\\nincluding Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), Latent\\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-\\ntion (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 1999).\\nThe LSA community seems to have ﬁrst used the word “embedding” in Landauer\\net al. (1997), in a variant of its mathematical meaning as a mapping from one space\\nor mathematical structure to another. In LSA, the word embedding seems to have\\ndescribed the mapping from the space of sparse count vectors to the latent space of\\nSVD dense vectors. Although the word thus originally meant the mapping from one'),\n",

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently\\nin network architecture, training strategy and optimization\\nfunction, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep\\nlearning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins\\nwith a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and\\nits representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection\\narchitectures along with some modiﬁcations and useful tricks\\nto improve detection performance further. As distinct speciﬁc\\ndetection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also brieﬂy\\nsurvey several speciﬁc tasks, including salient object detection,\\nface detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses\\nare also provided to compare various methods and draw some\\nmeaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and\\ntasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in\\nboth object detection and relevant neural network based learning\\nsystems.\\nIndex Terms—deep learning, object detection, neural network\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO gain a complete image understanding, we should not\\nonly concentrate on classifying different images, but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations of\\nobjects contained in each image. This task is referred as object\\ndetection [1][S1], which usually consists of different subtasks\\nsuch as face detection [2][S2], pedestrian detection [3][S2]\\nand skeleton detection [4][S3]. As one of the fundamental\\ncomputer vision problems, object detection is able to provide\\nvaluable information for semantic understanding of images\\nand videos, and is related to many applications, including\\nimage classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior analysis [7][S4],\\nface recognition [8][S5] and autonomous driving [9], [10].\\nMeanwhile, Inheriting from neural networks and related learn-\\ning systems, the progress in these ﬁelds will develop neural\\nnetwork algorithms, and will also have great impacts on object\\ndetection techniques which can be considered as learning\\nsystems. [11]–[14][S6]. However, due to large variations in\\nviewpoints, poses, occlusions and lighting conditions, it’s difﬁ-\\ncult to perfectly accomplish object detection with an additional\\nZhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng and Shou-Tao Xu are with the College of\\nComputer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technol-\\nogy, China.

So much attention has been attracted\\nto this ﬁeld in recent years [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). So the pipeline of traditional object detection models\\ncan be mainly divided into three stages: informative region\\nselection, feature extraction and classiﬁcation.\\nInformative region selection. As different objects may appear\\nin any positions of the image and have different aspect ratios\\nor sizes, it is a natural choice to scan the whole image with a\\nmulti-scale sliding window. Although this exhaustive strategy\\ncan ﬁnd out all possible positions of the objects, its short-\\ncomings are also obvious. Due to a large number of candidate\\nwindows, it is computationally expensive and produces too\\nmany redundant windows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of\\nsliding window templates are applied, unsatisfactory regions\\nmay be produced.\\nFeature extraction. To recognize different objects, we need\\nto extract visual features which can provide a semantic and\\nrobust representation. SIFT [19], HOG [20] and Haar-like [21]\\nfeatures are the representative ones. This is due to the fact\\nthat these features can produce representations associated with\\ncomplex cells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diver-\\nsity of appearances, illumination conditions and backgrounds,\\nit’s difﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nClassiﬁcation. Besides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish\\na target object from all the other categories and to make the\\nrepresentations more hierarchical, semantic and informative\\nfor visual recognition. Usually, the Supported Vector Machine\\n(SVM) [22], AdaBoost [23] and Deformable Part-based Model\\n(DPM) [24] are good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the\\nDPM is a ﬂexible model by combining object parts with\\ndeformation cost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with\\nthe aid of a graphical model, carefully designed low-level\\nfeatures and kinematically inspired part decompositions are\\ncombined. And discriminative learning of graphical models\\nallows for building high-precision part-based models for a\\nvariety of object classes.\\nBased on these discriminant local feature descriptors and\\nshallow learnable architectures, state of the art results have\\nbeen obtained on PASCAL VOC object detection competition\\n[25] and real-time embedded systems have been obtained with\\na low burden on hardware. However, small gains are obtained\\nduring 2010-2012 by only building ensemble systems and\\nemploying minor variants of successful methods [15]. This fact\\nis due to the following reasons: 1) The generation of candidate\\nbounding boxes with a sliding window strategy is redundant,\\ninefﬁcient and inaccurate. 2) The semantic gap cannot be\\narXiv:1807.05511v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2019'),\n",

They have deeper architectures with the\\ncapacity to learn more complex features than the shallow ones.\\nAlso the expressivity and robust training algorithms allow to\\nlearn informative object representations without the need to\\ndesign features manually [26].\\nSince the proposal of R-CNN, a great deal of improved\\nmodels have been suggested, including Fast R-CNN which\\njointly optimizes classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ntasks [16], Faster R-CNN which takes an additional sub-\\nnetwork to generate region proposals [18] and YOLO which\\naccomplishes object detection via a ﬁxed-grid regression [17].\\nAll of them bring different degrees of detection performance\\nimprovements over the primary R-CNN and make real-time\\nand accurate object detection become more achievable.\\nIn this paper, a systematic review is provided to summarise\\nrepresentative models and their different characteristics in\\nseveral application domains, including generic object detec-\\ntion [15], [16], [18], salient object detection [27], [28], face\\ndetection [29]–[31] and pedestrian detection [32], [33].

Therefore,\\ndifferent deep models are required by various images.\\nThere has been a relevant pioneer effort [34] which mainly\\nfocuses on relevant software tools to implement deep learning\\ntechniques for image classiﬁcation and object detection, but\\npays little attention on detailing speciﬁc algorithms. Different\\nfrom it, our work not only reviews deep learning based object\\ndetection models and algorithms covering different applica-\\ntion domains in detail, but also provides their corresponding\\nexperimental comparisons and meaningful analyses.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\\n2, a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and the\\nbasic architecture of CNN is provided. Generic object detec-\\ntion architectures are presented in Section 3.

Several promising future\\ndirections are proposed in Section 7. At last, some concluding\\nremarks are presented in Section 8.\\nII. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to overview on deep learning based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. The History: Birth, Decline and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date back\\nto 1940s [35], and the original intention was to simulate the\\nhuman brain system to solve general learning problems in a\\nprincipled way. It was popular in 1980s and 1990s with the\\nproposal of back-propagation algorithm by Hinton et al. [36].\\nHowever, due to the overﬁtting of training, lack of large scale\\ntraining data, limited computation power and insigniﬁcance\\nin performance compared with other machine learning tools,\\nneural networks fell out of fashion in early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [37][S7] with\\na break through in speech recognition [38]. The recovery of\\ndeep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n• The emergence of large scale annotated training data, such\\nas ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large learning\\ncapacity;\\n• Fast development of high performance parallel computing\\nsystems, such as GPU clusters;\\n• Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npre-training guided by Auto-Encoder (AE) [40] or Re-\\nstricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [41], a good initializa-\\ntion is provided. With dropout and data augmentation, the\\noverﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].\\nWith batch normalization (BN), the training of very deep\\nneural networks becomes quite efﬁcient [43]. Meanwhile,\\nvarious network structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat\\n[44], GoogLeNet [45], VGG [46] and ResNet [47], have\\nbeen extensively studied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on the\\nentire academic community? It may owe to the contribution of\\nHinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have demonstrated\\nthat deep learning would bring a revolutionary breakthrough\\non grand challenges rather than just obvious improvements on\\nsmall datasets. Their success results from training a large CNN\\non 1.2 million labeled images together with a few techniques\\n[6] (e.g., ReLU operation [48] and ‘dropout’ regularization).\\nB. Architecture and Advantages of CNN\\nCNN is the most representative model of deep learning [26].\\nA typical CNN architecture, which is referred to as VGG16,'),\n",

Each layer of CNN is known as a\\nfeature map. The feature map of the input layer is a 3D matrix\\nof pixel intensities for different color channels (e.g. RGB). The\\nfeature map of any internal layer is an induced multi-channel\\nimage, whose ‘pixel’ can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every\\nneuron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummaries the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an\\ninitial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. And the whole network can be optimized on\\nan objective function (e.g. mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers, 3\\nfully connected layers, 3 max-pooling layers and a softmax\\nclassiﬁcation layer. The conv feature maps are produced by\\nconvoluting 3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions\\nare reduced with 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test\\nimage of the same size as training samples can be processed\\nwith the trained network. Re-scaling or cropping operations\\nmay be needed if different sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarised as follows.\\n• Hierarchical feature representation, which is the multi-\\nlevel representations from pixel to high-level semantic fea-\\ntures learned by a hierarchical multi-stage structure [15],\\n[53], can be learned from data automatically and hidden\\nfactors of input data can be disentangled through multi-level\\nnonlinear mappings.\\n• Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expressive\\ncapability.\\n• The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g. Fast R-\\nCNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ninto a multi-task leaning manner).\\n• Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can be\\nrecast as high-dimensional data transform problems and\\nsolved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto many research ﬁelds, such as image super-resolution\\nreconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56], im-\\nage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8][S5], pedestrian\\ndetection [59]–[61] and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. GENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image, and labeling them with\\nrectangular bounding boxes to show the conﬁdences of exis-\\ntence. The frameworks of generic object detection methods\\ncan mainly be categorized into two types (see Figure 2).\\nOne follows traditional object detection pipeline, generating\\nregion proposals at ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into\\ndifferent object categories. The other regards object detection\\nas a regression or classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed\\nframework to achieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations)\\ndirectly. The region proposal based methods mainly include\\nR-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16], Faster R-CNN\\n[18], R-FCN [65], FPN [66] and Mask R-CNN [67], some of\\nwhich are correlated with each other (e.g. SPP-net modiﬁes R-\\nCNN with a SPP layer). The regression/classiﬁcation based\\nmethods mainly includes MultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69],\\nG-CNN [70], YOLO [17], SSD [71], YOLOv2 [72], DSSD\\n[73] and DSOD [74]. The correlations between these two\\npipelines are bridged by the anchors introduced in Faster R-\\nCNN. Details of these methods are as follows.\\nA. Region Proposal Based Framework\\nThe region proposal based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of human brain to some\\nextent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario ﬁrstly\\nand then focuses on regions of interest. Among the pre-related\\nworks [44], [75], [76], the most representative one is Overfeat\\n[44]. This model inserts CNN into sliding window method,\\nwhich predicts bounding boxes directly from locations of\\nthe topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality of\\ncandidate bounding boxes and to take a deep architecture to\\nextract high-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN\\n[15] was proposed by Ross Girshick in 2014 and obtained a\\nmean average precision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30%\\nimprovement over the previous best result (DPM HSC [77]) on\\nPASCAL VOC 2012. Figure 3 shows the ﬂowchart of R-CNN,\\nwhich can be divided into three stages as follows.\\nRegion proposal generation. The R-CNN adopts selective\\nsearch [78] to generate about 2k region proposals for each\\nimage. The selective search method relies on simple bottom-up\\ngrouping and saliency cues to provide more accurate candidate\\nboxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to reduce the searching\\nspace in object detection [24], [39].\\nCNN based deep feature extraction. In this stage, each\\nregion proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed resolution\\nand the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract a 4096-\\ndimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due to large\\nlearning capacity, dominant expressive power and hierarchical\\nstructure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic and robust feature\\nrepresentation for each region proposal can be obtained.\\nClassiﬁcation and localization. With pre-trained category-\\nspeciﬁc linear SVMs for multiple classes, different region pro-\\nposals are scored on a set of positive regions and background\\n(negative) regions. The scored regions are then adjusted with'),\n",

The ﬂowchart of R-CNN [15], which consists of 3 stages: (1) extracts\\nbottom-up region proposals, (2) computes features for each proposal using a\\nCNN, and then (3) classiﬁes each region with class-speciﬁc linear SVMs.\\nbounding box regression and ﬁltered with a greedy non-\\nmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal bounding boxes\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen there are scarce or insufﬁcient labeled data, pre-\\ntraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrstly conducts supervised pre-training\\non ILSVRC, a very large auxiliary dataset, and then takes a\\ndomain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by\\nmost of subsequent approaches [16], [18].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n• Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed-size (e.g., 227×227) input image, which directly leads\\nto the re-computation of the whole CNN for each evaluated\\nregion, taking a great deal of time in the testing period.\\n• Training of R-CNN is a multi-stage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals is\\nﬁne-tuned. Then the softmax classiﬁer learned by ﬁne-\\ntuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet features.\\nFinally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n• Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on the\\ndisk. It will take a long time to process a relatively small\\ntraining set with very deep networks, such as VGG16. At the\\nsame time, the storage memory required by these features\\nshould also be a matter of concern.\\n• Although selective search can generate region proposals\\nwith relatively high recalls, the obtained region proposals\\nare still redundant and this procedure is time-consuming\\n(around 2 seconds to extract 2k region proposals).\\nTo solve these problems, many methods have been pro-\\nposed. GOP [80] takes a much faster geodesic based segmen-\\ntation to replace traditional graph cuts. MCG [81] searches\\ndifferent scales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmen-\\ntations and combinatorially groups different regions to produce\\nproposals. Instead of extracting visually distinct segments,\\nthe edge boxes method [82] adopts the idea that objects are\\nmore likely to exist in bounding boxes with fewer contours\\nstraggling their boundaries. Also some researches tried to\\nre-rank or reﬁne pre-extracted region proposals to remove\\nunnecessary ones and obtained a limited number of valuable\\nones, such as DeepBox [83] and SharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na bayesian optimization based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different bounding boxes sequentially, and\\ntrained class-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss\\nto penalize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Saurabh\\nGupta et al. improved object detection for RGB-D images\\nwith semantically rich image and depth features [86], and\\nlearned a new geocentric embedding for depth images to\\nencode each pixel. The combination of object detectors and\\nsuperpixel classiﬁcation framework gains a promising result\\non semantic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. proposed\\na deformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) [87] which introduces\\na novel deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer\\nto impose geometric penalty on the deformation of various\\nobject parts and makes an ensemble of models with different\\nsettings. Lenc et al. [88] provided an analysis on the role\\nof proposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth bounding boxes with K-means\\nclustering. However, more candidate boxes are required to\\nachieve comparable results to those of R-CNN.\\n2) SPP-net: FC layers must take a ﬁxed-size input. That’s\\nwhy R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. took the theory of spatial\\npyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration and\\nproposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net [64]. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Figure 4. Different from R-CNN, SPP-net reuses\\nfeature maps of the 5-th conv layer (conv5) to project region'),\n",

The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses, but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64].

If the number\\nof feature maps in conv5 is 256, taking a 3-level pyramid,\\nthe ﬁnal feature vector for each region proposal obtained after\\nSPP layer has a dimension of 256 × (12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with correct estimation\\nof different region proposals in their corresponding scales, but\\nalso improves detection efﬁciency in testing period with the\\nsharing of computation cost before SPP layer among different\\nproposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost\\nthe same multi-stage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature\\nextraction, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training and bounding-\\nbox regressor ﬁtting. So an additional expense on storage space\\nis still required. Additionally, the conv layers preceding the\\nSPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multi-task loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Figure 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with a region of\\ninterest (RoI) pooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special\\ncase of the SPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each\\nfeature vector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before\\nﬁnally branching into two sibling output layers. One output\\nlayer is responsible for producing softmax probabilities for\\nall C + 1 categories (C object classes plus one ‘background’\\nclass) and the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-\\nbox positions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters\\nin these procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multi-task loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multi-tasks loss L is deﬁned as below to jointly train\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding-box regression,\\nL(p, u, tu, v) = Lcls(p, u) + λ[u ≥1]Lloc(tu, v)\\n(1)\\nwhere Lcls(p, u) = −log pu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p = (p0, · · · , pC) over the C +1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu, v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx, tu\\ny, tu\\nw, tu\\nh) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx, vy, vw, vh), where x, y, w, h denote the two\\ncoordinates of the box center, width, and height, respectively.\\nEach tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to specify an\\nobject proposal with a log-space height/width shift and scale-\\ninvariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator function\\n[u ≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs. To provide\\nmore robustness against outliers and eliminate the sensitivity\\nin exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted to ﬁt\\nbounding-box regressors as below\\nLloc(tu, v) =\\nX\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1(tu\\ni −vi)\\n(2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1(x) =\\n(\\n0.5x2\\nif |x| < 1\\n|x| −0.5\\notherwise\\n(3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two tricks\\nare of necessity. On one hand, if training samples (i.e. RoIs)\\ncome from different images, back-propagation through the\\nSPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN samples\\nmini-batches hierarchically, namely N images sampled ran-\\ndomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each image,\\nwhere R represents the number of RoIs. Critically, computa-\\ntion and memory are shared by RoIs from the same image in\\nthe forward and backward pass. On the other hand, much time\\nis spent in computing the FC layers during the forward pass\\n[16]. The truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [91]\\ncan be utilized to compress large FC layers and to accelerate\\nthe testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single-stage with a multi-task loss. It saves the additional\\nexpense on storage space, and improves both accuracy and\\nefﬁciency with more reasonable training schemes.\\n4) Faster R-CNN: Despite the attempt to generate candi-\\ndate boxes with biased sampling [88], state-of-the-art object\\ndetection networks mainly rely on additional methods, such as\\nselective search and Edgebox, to generate a candidate pool of\\nisolated region proposals. Region proposal computation is also\\na bottleneck in improving efﬁciency. To solve this problem,\\nRen et al. introduced an additional Region Proposal Network\\n(RPN) [18], [92], which acts in a nearly cost-free way by\\nsharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with a fully-convolutional network, which\\nhas the ability to predict object bounds and scores at each\\nposition simultaneously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image\\nof arbitrary size to generate a set of rectangular object propos-\\nals. RPN operates on a speciﬁc conv layer with the preceding\\nlayers shared with object detection network.'),\n",

This decomposition originates from pioneering\\nclassiﬁcation architectures (e.g. AlexNet [6] and VGG16 [46])\\nwhich consist of a convolutional subnetwork and several FC\\nlayers separated by a speciﬁc spatial pooling layer.\\nRecent state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation networks, such\\nas Residual Nets (ResNets) [47] and GoogLeNets [45], [93],\\nare fully convolutional.

Blue outlines indicate feature maps and thicker outlines denote\\nsemantically stronger features.\\nnatural to construct a fully convolutional object detection net-\\nwork without RoI-wise subnetwork. However, it turns out to be\\ninferior with such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistence is\\ndue to the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregion-wise layers. So Li et al. [65] proposed a region-based\\nfully convolutional networks (R-FCN, Fig. S2).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k × k ﬁrstly and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate the\\nresponses from these score maps. Finally, in each RoI, k2\\nposition-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a C + 1-d\\nvector and softmax responses across categories are computed.\\nAnother 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain class-agnostic\\nbounding boxes.\\nWith R-FCN, more powerful classiﬁcation networks can be\\nadopted to accomplish object detection in a fully-convolutional\\narchitecture by sharing nearly all the layers, and state-of-the-\\nart results are obtained on both PASCAL VOC and Microsoft\\nCOCO [94] datasets at a test speed of 170ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in\\nmany object detection systems to improve scale invariance\\n[24], [64] (Figure 7(a)).

The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nresolution maps of the feature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an ar-\\nchitecture with a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway\\nand several lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and seman-\\ntically weak features (Figure 7(d)). The bottom-up pathway,\\nwhich is the basic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a\\nfeature hierarchy by downsampling the corresponding feature\\nmaps with a stride of 2. The layers owning the same size of\\noutput maps are grouped into the same network stage and the\\noutput of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference\\nset of feature maps to build the following top-down pathway.\\nTo build the top-down pathway, feature maps from higher\\nnetwork stages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with\\nthose of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway\\nvia lateral connections. A 1 × 1 conv layer is appended to\\nthe upsampled map to reduce channel dimensions and the\\nmergence is achieved by element-wise addition. Finally, a 3×3\\nconvolution is also appended to each merged map to reduce\\nthe aliasing effect of upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is\\ngenerated. This process is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution\\nmap is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all\\nlevels and be trained end-to-end with all scales, state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g. region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g. instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nAnd the multi-task scheme will create spurious edge and\\nexhibit systematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To\\nsolve this problem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster\\nR-CNN for classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the\\nMask R-CNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation\\nmasks in a pixel-to-pixel manner (Figure 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches which are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m × m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that of [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multi-task\\nloss. An this loss is only associated with ground-truth class\\nand relies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch only\\nadds a small computational burden and its cooperation with\\nother tasks provides complementary information for object\\ndetection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to implement\\nwith promising instance segmentation and object detection\\nresults. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient\\nframework for instance-level recognition, which can be easily\\ngeneralized to other tasks (e.g. human pose estimation [7][S4])\\nwith minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multi-task Learning, Multi-scale Representation and\\nContextual Modelling:\\nAlthough the Faster R-CNN gets\\npromising results with several hundred proposals, it still strug-\\ngles in small-size object detection and localization, mainly due\\nto the coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO dataset which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmulti-task learning [100], multi-scale representation [95] and\\ncontext modelling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMulti-task Learning learns a useful representation for\\nmultiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. introduced conv features trained for ob-\\nject segmentation and ‘stuff’ (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet) [100].

To this end, objects are\\nﬁrstly clustered into visually similar class groups, and then a\\nhierarchical feature learning scheme is adopted to learn deep\\nrepresentations for each group separately.\\nIn order to minimize computational cost and achieve the\\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the ‘deep and thin’ design\\nprinciple and following the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, Hong et\\nal. proposed the architecture of PVANET [116], which adopts\\nsome building blocks including concatenated ReLU [117],\\nInception [45], and HyperNet [101] to reduce the expense on\\nmulti-scale feature extraction and trains the network with batch\\nnormalization [43], residual connections [47], and learning\\nrate scheduling based on plateau detection [47]. The PVANET\\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance and can be processed\\nin real time on Titan X GPU (21 FPS).\\nB. Regression/Classiﬁcation Based Framework\\nRegion proposal based frameworks are composed of sev-\\neral correlated stages, including region proposal generation,\\nfeature extraction with CNN, classiﬁcation and bounding box\\nregression, which are usually trained separately. Even in recent\\nend-to-end module Faster R-CNN, an alternative training is\\nstill required to obtain shared convolution parameters between\\nRPN and detection network. As a result, the time spent in\\nhandling different components becomes the bottleneck in real-\\ntime application.\\nOne-step\\nframeworks\\nbased\\non\\nglobal\\nregres-\\nsion/classiﬁcation, mapping straightly from image pixels\\nto bounding box coordinates and class probabilities, can\\nreduce time expense. We ﬁrstly reviews some pioneer CNN\\nmodels, and then focus on two signiﬁcant frameworks,\\nnamely You only look once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71].\\n1) Pioneer Works: Previous to YOLO and SSD, many\\nresearchers have already tried to model object detection as\\na regression or classiﬁcation task.\\nSzegedy et al. formulated object detection task as a DNN-\\nbased regression [118], generating a binary mask for the\\ntest image and extracting detections with a simple bounding\\nbox inference. However, the model has difﬁculty in handling\\noverlapping objects, and bounding boxes generated by direct\\nupsampling is far from perfect.\\nPinheiro et al. proposed a CNN model with two branches:\\none generates class agnostic segmentation masks and the\\nother predicts the likelihood of a given patch centered on\\nan object [119]. Inference is efﬁcient since class scores and\\nsegmentation can be obtained in a single model with most of\\nthe CNN operations shared.\\nErhan et al. proposed regression based MultiBox to produce\\nscored class-agnostic region proposals [68], [120]. A uniﬁed\\nloss was introduced to bias both localization and conﬁdences\\nof multiple components to predict the coordinates of class-\\nagnostic bounding boxes. However, a large quantity of addi-\\ntional parameters are introduced to the ﬁnal layer.\\nYoo et al. adopted an iterative classiﬁcation approach to\\nhandle object detection and proposed an impressive end-to-\\nend CNN architecture named AttentionNet [69]. Starting from\\nthe top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corner of an image,\\nAttentionNet points to a target object by generating quantized\\nweak directions and converges to an accurate object bound-\\nary box with an ensemble of iterative predictions. However,\\nthe model becomes quite inefﬁcient when handling multiple\\ncategories with a progressive two-step procedure.\\nNajibi et al. proposed a proposal-free iterative grid based\\nobject detector (G-CNN), which models object detection as'),\n",

Main idea of YOLO [17].\\nﬁnding a path from a ﬁxed grid to boxes tightly surrounding\\nthe objects [70]. Starting with a ﬁxed multi-scale bounding box\\ngrid, G-CNN trains a regressor to move and scale elements of\\nthe grid towards objects iteratively. However, G-CNN has a\\ndifﬁculty in dealing with small or highly overlapping objects.\\n2) YOLO: Redmon et al. [17] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes use of the whole topmost feature\\nmap to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories and\\nbounding boxes. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in\\nFigure 9. YOLO divides the input image into an S × S grid and\\neach grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes\\nand their corresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁ-\\ndence scores are deﬁned as Pr(Object) ∗IOU truth\\npred , which\\nindicates how likely there exist objects (Pr(Object) ≥0) and\\nshows conﬁdences of its prediction (IOU truth\\npred ). At the same\\ntime, regardless of the number of boxes, C conditional class\\nprobabilities (Pr(Classi|Object)) should also be predicted in\\neach grid cell. It should be noticed that only the contribution\\nfrom the grid cell containing an object is calculated.\\nAt test time, class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box\\nare achieved by multiplying the individual box conﬁdence\\npredictions with the conditional class probabilities as follows.\\nPr(Object) ∗IOU truth\\npred ∗Pr(Classi|Object)\\n= Pr(Classi) ∗IOU truth\\npred\\n(5)\\nwhere the existing probability of class-speciﬁc objects in the\\nbox and the ﬁtness between the predicted box and the object\\nare both taken into consideration.\\nDuring training, the following loss function is optimized,\\nλcoord\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1obj\\nij\\n\\x02\\n(xi −ˆxi)2 + (yi −ˆyi)2\\x03\\n+λcoord\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1obj\\nij\\n\"\\x12√wi −\\np\\nˆwi)2 + (\\np\\nhi −\\nq\\nˆhi\\n\\x132#\\n+\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1obj\\nij\\n\\x10\\nCi −ˆCi\\n\\x112\\n+λnoobj\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1noobj\\nij\\n\\x10\\nCi −ˆCi\\n\\x112\\n+\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\n1obj\\ni\\nX\\nc∈classes\\n(pi(c) −ˆpi(c))2\\n(6)\\nIn a certain cell i, (xi, yi) denote the center of the box relative\\nto the bounds of the grid cell, (wi, hi) are the normalized width\\nand height relative to the image size, Ci represents conﬁdence\\nscores, 1obj\\ni\\nindicates the existence of objects and 1obj\\nij\\ndenotes\\nthat the prediction is conducted by the jth bounding box\\npredictor. Note that only when an object is present in that grid\\ncell, the loss function penalizes classiﬁcation errors. Similarly,\\nwhen the predictor is ‘responsible’ for the ground truth box\\n(i.e. the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell is\\nachieved), bounding box coordinate errors are penalized.\\nThe YOLO consists of 24 conv layers and 2 FC layers,\\nof which some conv layers construct ensembles of inception\\nmodules with 1 × 1 reduction layers followed by 3 × 3 conv\\nlayers. The network can process images in real-time at 45\\nFPS and a simpliﬁed version Fast YOLO can reach 155 FPS\\nwith better results than other real-time detectors. Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on background, which\\nmakes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become possible. An\\nimproved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed in [72], which\\nadopts several impressive strategies, such as BN, anchor boxes,\\ndimension cluster and multi-scale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial constraints\\nimposed on bounding box predictions [17]. Meanwhile, YOLO\\nstruggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual aspect ratios/\\nconﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse features due to\\nmultiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. proposed a Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], which was inspired by the\\nanchors adopted in MultiBox [68], RPN [18] and multi-scale\\nrepresentation [95]. Given a speciﬁc feature map, instead of\\nﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD takes advantage of a set\\nof default anchor boxes with different aspect ratios and scales\\nto discretize the output space of bounding boxes. To handle\\nobjects with various sizes, the network fuses predictions from\\nmultiple feature maps with different resolutions .\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Figure 10. Given\\nthe VGG16 backbone architecture, SSD adds several feature\\nlayers to the end of the network, which are responsible for\\npredicting the offsets to default boxes with different scales and\\naspect ratios and their associated conﬁdences. The network is\\ntrained with a weighted sum of localization loss (e.g. Smooth\\nL1) and conﬁdence loss (e.g. Softmax), which is similar to\\n(1). Final detection results are obtained by conducting NMS\\non multi-scale reﬁned bounding boxes.\\nIntegrating with hard negative mining, data augmentation\\nand a larger number of carefully chosen default anchors,\\nSSD signiﬁcantly outperforms the Faster R-CNN in terms of\\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC and COCO, while being three\\ntimes faster. The SSD300 (input image size is 300×300) runs\\nat 59 FPS, which is more accurate and efﬁcient than YOLO.\\nHowever, SSD is not skilled at dealing with small objects,\\nwhich can be relieved by adopting better feature extractor\\nbackbone (e.g. ResNet101), adding deconvolution layers with\\nskip connections to introduce additional large-scale context\\n[73] and designing better network structure (e.g. Stem Block\\nand Dense Block) [74].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nWe compare various object detection methods on three\\nbenchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2007 [25],\\nPASCAL VOC 2012 [121] and Microsoft COCO [94]. The\\nevaluated approaches include R-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast\\nR-CNN [16], NOC [114], Bayes [85], MR-CNN&S-CNN\\n[105], Faster R-CNN [18], HyperNet [101], ION [95], MS-\\nGR [104], StuffNet [100], SSD300 [71], SSD512 [71], OHEM\\n[113], SDP+CRC [33], GCNN [70], SubCNN [60], GBD-Net\\n[109], PVANET [116], YOLO [17], YOLOv2 [72], R-FCN\\n[65], FPN [66], Mask R-CNN [67], DSSD [73] and DSOD\\n[74]. If no speciﬁc instructions for the adopted framework\\nare provided, the utilized model is a VGG16 [46] pretrained\\non 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁcation task [39]. Due to the\\nlimitation of paper length, we only provide an overview, in-\\ncluding proposal, learning method, loss function, programming\\nlanguage and platform, of the prominent architectures in Table\\nI. Detailed experimental settings, which can be found in the\\noriginal papers, are missed. In addition to the comparisons of\\ndetection accuracy, another comparison is provided to evaluate\\ntheir test consumption on PASCAL VOC 2007.\\n1) PASCAL VOC 2007/2012: PASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012 datasets consist of 20 categories. The evaluation terms\\nare Average Precision (AP) in each single category and mean\\nAverage Precision (mAP) across all the 20 categories. Com-\\nparative results are exhibited in Table II and III, from which\\nthe following remarks can be obtained.\\n• If incorporated with a proper way, more powerful back-\\nbone CNN models can deﬁnitely improve object detection\\nperformance (the comparison among R-CNN with AlexNet,\\nR-CNN with VGG16 and SPP-net with ZF-Net [122]).\\n• With the introduction of SPP layer (SPP-net), end-to-\\nend multi-task architecture (FRCN) and RPN (Faster R-\\nCNN), object detection performance is improved gradually\\nand apparently.\\n• Due to large quantities of trainable parameters, in order to\\nobtain multi-level robust features, data augmentation is very\\nimportant for deep learning based models (Faster R-CNN\\nwith ‘07’ ,‘07+12’ and ‘07+12+coco’).\\n• Apart from basic models, there are still many other factors\\naffecting object detection performance, such as multi-scale\\nand multi-region feature extraction (e.g. MR-CNN), modi-\\nﬁed classiﬁcation networks (e.g. NOC), additional informa-\\ntion from other correlated tasks (e.g. StuffNet, HyperNet),\\nmulti-scale representation (e.g. ION) and mining of hard\\nnegative samples (e.g. OHEM).\\n• As YOLO is not skilled in producing object localizations\\nof high IoU, it obtains a very poor result on VOC 2012.\\nHowever, with the complementary information from Fast\\nR-CNN (YOLO+FRCN) and the aid of other strategies,\\nsuch as anchor boxes, BN and ﬁne grained features, the\\nlocalization errors are corrected (YOLOv2).\\n• By combining many recent tricks and modelling the whole\\nnetwork as a fully convolutional one, R-FCN achieves a\\nmore obvious improvement of detection performance over\\nother approaches.\\n2) Microsoft COCO: Microsoft COCO is composed of\\n300,000 fully segmented images, in which each image has\\nan average of 7 object instances from a total of 80 categories.\\nAs there are a lot of less iconic objects with a broad range\\nof scales and a stricter requirement on object localization,\\nthis dataset is more challenging than PASCAL 2012. Object\\ndetection performance is evaluated by AP computed under\\ndifferent degrees of IoUs and on different object sizes. The\\nresults are shown in Table IV.\\nBesides similar remarks to those of PASCAL VOC, some\\nother conclusions can be drawn as follows from Table IV.\\n• Multi-scale training and test are beneﬁcial in improv-\\ning object detection performance, which provide additional\\ninformation in different resolutions (R-FCN). FPN and\\nDSSD provide some better ways to build feature pyramids\\nto achieve multi-scale representation. The complementary\\ninformation from other related tasks is also helpful for\\naccurate object localization (Mask R-CNN with instance\\nsegmentation task).\\n•\\nOverall,\\nregion\\nproposal\\nbased\\nmethods,\\nsuch\\nas\\nFaster R-CNN and R-FCN, perform better than regres-\\nsion/classﬁcation based approaches, namely YOLO and\\nSSD, due to the fact that quite a lot of localization errors\\nare produced by regression/classﬁcation based approaches.\\n• Context modelling is helpful to locate small objects,\\nwhich provides additional information by consulting nearby\\nobjects and surroundings (GBD-Net and multi-path).\\n• Due to the existence of a large number of nonstandard\\nsmall objects, the results on this dataset are much worse\\nthan those of VOC 2007/2012. With the introduction of\\nother powerful frameworks (e.g. ResNeXt [123]) and useful\\nstrategies (e.g. multi-task learning [67], [124]), the perfor-\\nmance can be improved.\\n• The success of DSOD in training from scratch stresses the\\nimportance of network design to release the requirements\\nfor perfect pre-trained classiﬁers on relevant tasks and large\\nnumbers of annotated samples.\\n3) Timing Analysis: Timing analysis (Table V) is conducted\\non Intel i7-6700K CPU with a single core and NVIDIA Titan'),\n",

Also, region proposal based models\\ncan be modiﬁed into real-time systems with the introduction\\nof other tricks [116] (PVANET), such as BN [43], residual\\nconnections [123].\\nIV. SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous ap-\\nplications incorporate the visual saliency to improve their\\nperformance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation\\n[126], image retrieval [57] and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely bottom-up (BU) [127] and top-down\\n(TD) [128]. Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is task-\\noriented and takes prior knowledge about object categories\\nto guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and multi-\\nscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133] and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Eleonora Vig et al. [28] follows a\\ncompletely automatic data-driven approach to perform a large-\\nscale search for optimal features, namely an ensemble of deep\\nnetworks with different layers and parameters. To address the\\nproblem of limited training data, Kummerer et al. proposed the\\nDeep Gaze [134] by transferring from the AlexNet to generate\\na high dimensional feature space and create a saliency map. A\\nsimilar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. to integrate\\nsaliency prediction into pre-trained object recognition DNNs\\n[135]. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as Similarity, KL-Divergence and\\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency.\\nSome works combined local and global visual clues to\\nimprove salient object detection performance. Wang et al.\\ntrained two independent deep CNNs (DNN-L and DNN-G)\\nto capture local information and global contrast and predicted\\nsaliency maps by integrating both local estimation and global\\nsearch [136]. Cholakkal et al. proposed a weakly supervised\\nsaliency detection framework to combine visual saliency from\\nbottom-up and top-down saliency maps, and reﬁned the results\\nwith a multi-scale superpixel-averaging [137]. Zhao et al.\\nproposed a multi-context deep learning framework, which\\nutilizes a uniﬁed learning framework to model global and\\nlocal context jointly with the aid of superpixel segmentation\\n[138]. To predict saliency in videos, Bak et al. fused two\\nstatic saliency models, namely spatial stream net and tem-\\nporal stream net, into a two-stream framework with a novel\\nempirically grounded data augmentation technique [139].\\nComplementary information from semantic segmentation\\nand context modeling is beneﬁcial. To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. proposed a novel su-\\nperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN [140], in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully convolutional neural network, Li\\net al. proposed a multi-task deep saliency model, in which\\nintrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic\\nsegmentation are set up [141]. However, due to the conv layers\\nwith large receptive ﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object\\nboundaries and coarse saliency maps are produced. Tang et\\nal. proposed a novel saliency detection framework (CRPSD)\\n[142], which combines region-level saliency estimation and\\npixel-level saliency prediction together with three closely\\nrelated CNNs. Li et al. proposed a deep contrast network\\nto combine segment-wise spatial pooling and pixel-level fully\\nconvolutional streams [143].\\nThe proper integration of multi-scale feature maps is also\\nof signiﬁcance for improving detection performance. Based\\non Fast R-CNN, Wang et al. proposed the RegionNet by\\nperforming salient object detection with end-to-end edge pre-\\nserving and multi-scale contextual modelling [144]. Liu et al.\\n[27] proposed a multi-resolution convolutional neural network\\n(Mr-CNN) to predict eye ﬁxations, which is achieved by\\nlearning both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down visual\\nfactors from raw image data simultaneously. Cornia et al.\\nproposed an architecture which combines features extracted at\\ndifferent levels of the CNN [145]. Li et al. proposed a multi-\\nscale deep CNN framework to extract three scales of deep\\ncontrast features [146], namely the mean-subtracted region,\\nthe bounding box of its immediate neighboring regions and\\nthe masked entire image, from each candidate region.\\nIt is efﬁcient and accurate to train a direct pixel-wise\\nCNN architecture to predict salient objects with the aids of\\nRNNs and deconvolution networks. Pan et al. formulated\\nsaliency prediction as a minimization optimization on the\\nEuclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and\\nthe ground truth and proposed two kinds of architectures\\n[147]: a shallow one trained from scratch and a deeper one\\nadapted from deconvoluted VGG network. As convolutional-\\ndeconvolution networks are not expert in recognizing objects\\nof multiple scales, Kuen et al. proposed a recurrent attentional\\nconvolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN) with several\\nspatial transformer and recurrent network units to conquer\\nthis problem [148]. To fuse local, global and contextual\\ninformation of salient objects, Tang et al. developed a deeply-\\nsupervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN)\\nto perform a full image-to-image saliency detection [149].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative datasets, including ECSSD [156], HKU-\\nIS [146], PASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to\\nevaluate several state-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of\\n1000 structurally complex but semantically meaningful natural\\nimages. HKU-IS is a large-scale dataset containing over 4000\\nchallenging images. Most of these images have more than\\none salient object and own low contrast. PASCALS is a\\nsubset chosen from the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010\\nsegmentation dataset and is composed of 850 natural images.\\nThe SOD dataset possesses 300 images containing multiple\\nsalient objects. The training and validation sets for different\\ndatasets are kept the same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map. Given precision and recall values pre-computed\\non the union of generated binary mask B and ground truth Z,\\nF-measure is deﬁned as below\\nFβ = (1 + β2)Presion × Recall\\nβ2Presion + Recall\\n(7)\\nwhere β2 is set to 0.3 in order to stress the importance of the\\nprecision value.\\nThe MAE score is computed with the following equation\\nMAE =\\n1\\nH × W\\nH\\nX\\ni=1\\nW\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c ˆS(i, j) = ˆZ(i, j)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n(8)\\nwhere ˆZ and ˆS represent the ground truth and the continuous\\nsaliency map, respectively. W and H are the width and\\nheight of the salient area, respectively. This score stresses\\nthe importance of successfully detected salient objects over\\ndetected non-salient pixels [159].\\nThe following approaches are evaluated: CHM [150], RC\\n[151], DRFI [152], MC [138], MDF [146], LEGS [136], DSR\\n[149], MTDNN [141], CRPSD [142], DCL [143], ELD [153],\\nNLDF [154] and DSSC [155]. Among these methods, CHM,\\nRC and DRFI are classical ones with the best performance\\n[159], while the other methods are all associated with CNN.\\nF-measure and MAE scores are shown in Table VI.\\nFrom Table VI, we can ﬁnd that CNN based methods\\nperform better than classic methods. MC and MDF combine\\nthe information from local and global context to reach a\\nmore accurate saliency. ELD refers to low-level handcrafted\\nfeatures for complementary information. LEGS adopts generic\\nregion proposals to provide initial salient regions, which may\\nbe insufﬁcient for salient detection. DSR and MT act in\\ndifferent ways by introducing recurrent network and semantic\\nsegmentation, which provide insights for future improvements.\\nCPRSD, DCL, NLDF and DSSC are all based on multi-scale\\nrepresentations and superpixel segmentation, which provide\\nrobust salient regions and smooth boundaries. DCL, NLDF\\nand DSSC perform the best on these four datasets. DSSC\\nearns the best performance by modelling scale-to-scale short-\\nconnections.\\nOverall, as CNN mainly provides salient information in\\nlocal regions, most of CNN based methods need to model\\nvisual saliency along region boundaries with the aid of su-\\nperpixel segmentation. Meanwhile, the extraction of multi-\\nscale deep CNN features is of signiﬁcance for measuring local\\nconspicuity. Finally, it’s necessary to strengthen local con-\\nnections between different CNN layers and as well to utilize\\ncomplementary information from local and global context.\\nV. FACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications and acts\\nas an important pre-processing procedure to face recognition\\n[160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164] and facial expression\\nanalysis [165]. Different from generic object detection, this\\ntask is to recognize and locate face regions covering a very\\nlarge range of scales (30-300 pts vs. 10-1000 pts). At the same\\ntime, faces have their unique object structural conﬁgurations\\n(e.g. the distribution of different face parts) and characteristics\\n(e.g. skin color). All these differences lead to special attention\\nto this task. However, large visual variations of faces, such as\\nocclusions, pose variations and illumination changes, impose\\ngreat challenges for this task in real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-Like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al. proposed a deformable part model (DPM) for face\\ndetection [24]. However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nBesides, their performance is greatly restricted by manually\\ndesigned features and shallow architecture.\\nA. Deep learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169].As less accurate localization re-\\nsults from independent regressions of object coordinates, Yu\\net al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for predicting\\nthe four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168] proposed a\\nDeep Dense Face Detector (DDFD) to conduct multi-view face\\ndetection, which is able to detect faces in a wide range of ori-\\nentations without requirement of pose/landmark annotations.\\nYang et al. proposed a novel deep learning based face detection\\nframework [169], which collects the responses from local fa-\\ncial parts (e.g. eyes, nose and mouths) to address face detection\\nunder severe occlusions and unconstrained pose variations.\\nYang et al. [170] proposed a scale-friendly detection network\\nnamed ScaleFace, which splits a large range of target scales\\ninto smaller sub-ranges. Different specialized sub-networks are\\nconstructed on these sub-scales and combined into a single\\none to conduct end-to-end optimization. Hao et al. designed an\\nefﬁcient CNN to predict the scale distribution histogram of the\\nfaces and took this histogram to guide the zoom-in and zoom-\\nout of the image [171]. Since the faces are approximately\\nin uniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-\\nthe-art baselines, better performance is achieved with less\\ncomputation cost. Besides, some generic detection frameworks'),\n",

Huang et al. proposed a uniﬁed end-\\nto-end FCN framework called DenseBox to jointly conduct\\nface detection and landmark localization [174]. Li et al.\\n[175] proposed a multi-task discriminative learning framework\\nwhich integrates a ConvNet with a ﬁxed 3D mean face model\\nin an end-to-end manner. In the framework, two issues are\\naddressed to transfer from generic object detection to face\\ndetection, namely eliminating predeﬁned anchor boxes by a\\n3D mean face model and replacing RoI pooling layer with\\na conﬁguration pooling layer.

To achieve real-time detection on mobile platform,\\nKalinovskii and Spitsyn proposed a new solution of frontal\\nface detection based on compact CNN cascades [177]. This\\nmethod takes a cascade of three simple CNNs to generate,\\nclassify and reﬁne candidate object positions progressively.\\nTo reduce the effects of large pose variations, Chen et al.\\nproposed a cascaded CNN denoted by Supervised Transformer\\nNetwork [31]. This network takes a multi-task RPN to predict\\ncandidate face regions along with associated facial landmarks\\nsimultaneously, and adopts a generic R-CNN to verify the\\nexistence of valid faces. Yang et al. proposed a three-stage\\ncascade structure based on FCNs [8], while in each stage, a\\nmulti-scale FCN is utilized to reﬁne the positions of possible\\nfaces. Qin et al. proposed a uniﬁed framework which achieves\\nbetter results with the complementary information from dif-\\nferent jointly trained CNNs [178].\\nB. Experimental Evaluation\\nThe FDDB [179] dataset has a total of 2,845 pictures in\\nwhich 5,171 faces are annotated with elliptical shape. Two\\ntypes of evaluations are used: the discrete score and continuous\\nscore.

Unitbox\\nprovides an alternative choice for performance improvements\\nby carefully designing optimization loss.\\nFrom these results, we can draw the conclusion that\\nCNN based methods are in the leading position. The perfor-\\nmance can be improved by the following strategies: designing\\nnovel optimization loss, modifying generic detection pipelines,\\nbuilding meaningful network cascades, adapting scale-aware\\ndetection and learning multi-task shared CNN features.\\nVI. PEDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nRecently, pedestrian detection has been intensively studied,\\nwhich has a close relationship to pedestrian tracking [189],\\n[190], person re-identiﬁcation [191], [192] and robot naviga-\\ntion [193], [194]. Prior to the recent progress in DCNN based\\nmethods [195], [196], some researchers combined boosted\\ndecision forests with hand-crafted features to obtain pedestrian\\ndetectors [197]–[199]. At the same time, to explicitly model\\nthe deformation and occlusion, part-based models [200] and\\nexplicit occlusion handling [201], [202] are of concern.\\nAs there are many pedestrian instances of small sizes\\nin typical scenarios of pedestrian detection (e.g. automatic\\ndriving and intelligent surveillance), the application of RoI\\npooling layer in generic object detection pipeline may result\\nin ‘plain’ features due to collapsing bins. In the meantime, the\\nmain source of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small\\ninstances and hard negative examples. To deal with complex\\nocclusions existing in pedestrian images, inspired by DPM\\n[24], Tian et al. proposed a deep learning framework called\\nDeepParts [204], which makes decisions based an ensemble of\\nextensive part detectors. DeepParts has advantages in dealing\\nwith weakly labeled data, low IoU positive proposals and\\npartial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary in-\\nformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep adopts\\na complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted features\\nand ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster R-CNN, Liu et\\nal. proposed multi-spectral deep neural networks for pedestrian\\ndetection to combine complementary information from color\\nand thermal images [205]. Tian et al. [206] proposed a task-\\nassistant CNN (TA-CNN) to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nTABLE VII\\nDETAILED BREAKDOWN PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS OF\\nSTATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS ON CALTECH PEDESTRIAN DATASET.

Du et al. proposed\\na deep neural network fusion architecture for fast and robust\\npedestrian detection [207]. Based on the candidate bounding\\nboxes generated with SSD detectors [71], multiple binary\\nclassiﬁers are processed parallelly to conduct soft-rejection\\nbased network fusion (SNF) by consulting their aggregated\\ndegree of conﬁdences.\\nHowever, most of these approaches are much more sophisti-\\ncated than the standard R-CNN framework. CompACT-Deep\\nconsists of a variety of hand-crafted features, a small CNN\\nmodel and a large VGG16 model [195]. DeepParts contains\\n45 ﬁne-tuned DCNN models, and a set of strategies, including\\nbounding box shifting handling and part selection, are required\\nto arrive at the reported results [204]. So the modiﬁcation and\\nsimpliﬁcation is of signiﬁcance to reduce the burden on both\\nsoftware and hardware to satisfy real-time detection demand.\\nTome et al. proposed a novel solution to adapt generic object\\ndetection pipeline to pedestrian detection by optimizing most\\nof its stages [59]. Hu et al. [208] trained an ensemble of\\nboosted decision models by reusing the conv feature maps, and\\na further improvement was gained with simple pixel labelling\\nand additional complementary hand-crafted features. Tome\\net al. [209] proposed a reduced memory region based deep\\nCNN architecture, which fuses regional responses from both\\nACF detectors and SVM classiﬁers into R-CNN.

Experimental Evaluation\\nThe evaluation is conducted on the most popular Caltech\\nPedestrian dataset [3].

According to the differences in the\\nheight and visible part of the BBs, a total of 9 popular settings\\nare adopted to evaluate different properties of these models.\\nDetails of these settings are as [3].\\nEvaluated methods include Checkerboards+ [198], LDCF++\\n[S2], SCF+AlexNet [210], SA-FastRCNN [211], MS-CNN'),\n",

The ﬁrst two methods are based\\non hand-crafted features while the rest ones rely on deep CNN\\nfeatures. All results are exhibited in Table VII. From this table,\\nwe observe that different from other tasks, classic handcrafted\\nfeatures can still earn competitive results with boosted decision\\nforests [203], ACF [197] and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As\\nan early attempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the\\nfeatures generated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant\\nand produce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due to\\ncomplexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time de-\\ntection. The multi-scale representation of MS-CNN improves\\naccuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends Fast\\nR-CNN to automatically detecting pedestrians according to\\ntheir different scales, which has trouble when there are partial\\nocclusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced by\\nFaster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN based methods can provide more accurate\\ncandidate boxes and multi-level semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multi-scale and part based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. PROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO dataset and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n• Multi-task joint optimization and multi-modal infor-\\nmation fusion. Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4]. Besides, given a speciﬁc\\napplication, the information from different modalities, such\\nas text [212], thermal data [205] and images [65], can be\\nfused together to achieve a more discriminant network.\\n• Scale adaption. Objects usually exist in different scales,\\nwhich is more apparent in face detection and pedestrian\\ndetection. To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid. For\\nscale-adaptive detectors, it is useful to combine knowledge\\ngraph [215], attentional mechanism [216], cascade network\\n[180] and scale distribution estimation [171] to detect ob-\\njects adaptively.\\n• Spatial correlations and contextual modelling. Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detection. So\\nregion proposal generation and grid regression are taken\\nto obtain probable object locations. However, the corre-\\nlations between multiple proposals and object categories\\nare ignored. Besides, the global structure information is\\nabandoned by the position-sensitive score maps in R-FCN.\\nTo solve these problems, we can refer to diverse subset\\nselection [217] and sequential reasoning tasks [218] for\\npossible solutions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts\\nand couple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor and\\naccomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence of\\nlarge-scale image and video data. The following three aspects\\ncan be taken into account.\\n• Cascade network. In a cascade network, a cascade of\\ndetectors are built in different stages or layers [180], [220].\\nAnd easily distinguishable examples are rejected at shallow\\nlayers so that features and classiﬁers at latter stages can\\nhandle more difﬁcult samples with the aid of the decisions\\nfrom previous stages. However, current cascades are built in\\na greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are ﬁxed\\nwhen training a new stage. So the optimizations of different\\nCNNs are isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-\\nend optimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it\\nis also a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n• Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. It’s\\nvery time consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof bounding boxes. To release this burden, semantic prior\\n[55], unsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222] and deep neural network prediction [47] can\\nbe integrated to make best use of image-level supervision to\\nassign object category tags to corresponding object regions\\nand reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore, weakly annota-\\ntions (e.g. center-click annotations [223]) are also helpful\\nfor achieving high-quality detectors with modest annotation\\nefforts, especially aided by the mobile platform.\\n• Network optimization. Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among speed,'),\n",

However, despite that detection\\naccuracy is reduced, it is more meaningful to learn compact\\nmodels with fewer number of parameters [209]. And this\\nsituation can be relieved by introducing better pre-training\\nschemes [225], knowledge distillation [226] and hint learn-\\ning [227]. DSOD also provides a promising guideline to\\ntrain from scratch to bridge the gap between different image\\nsources and tasks [74].\\nThe third one is to extend typical methods for 2D object de-\\ntection to adapt 3D object detection and video object detection,\\nwith the requirements from autonomous driving, intelligent\\ntransportation and intelligent surveillance.\\n• 3D object detection. With the applications of 3D sensors\\n(e.g. LIDAR and camera), additional depth information can\\nbe utilized to better understand the images in 2D and extend\\nthe image-level knowledge to the real world. However,\\nseldom of these 3D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3D bounding boxes around detected objects. To achieve\\nbetter bounding results, multi-view representation [181] and\\n3D proposal network [228] may provide some guidelines to\\nencode depth information with the aid of inertial sensors\\n(accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].\\n• Video object detection. Temporal information across\\ndifferent frames play an important role in understanding\\nthe behaviors of different objects. However, the accuracy\\nsuffers from degenerated object appearances (e.g., motion\\nblur and video defocus) in videos and the network is\\nusually not trained end-to-end. To this end, spatiotemporal\\ntubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199] and LSTM [107] should\\nbe considered to fundamentally model object associations\\nbetween consecutive frames.\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation and background\\nswitches, deep learning based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning based object detection frameworks\\nwhich handle different sub-problems, such as occlusion, clutter\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely salient object\\ndetection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object\\ndetection landscape. This review is also meaningful for the\\ndevelopments in neural networks and related learning systems,\\nwhich provides valuable insights and guidelines for future\\nprogress.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Sci-\\nence Foundation of China (No.61672203 & 61375047 &\\n91746209), the National Key Research and Development Pro-\\ngram of China (2016YFB1000901), and Anhui Natural Sci-\\nence Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (No.170808J08).\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] P.

This summary helps the reader follow your argument in the \\nproposal itself. For example:  \\n\"Annunciation Shelter requests $5,000 for a two-year, $50,000 job training program for \\nhomeless women in southwestern Minnesota. Training will be offered at four rural \\nshelters and will include basic clerical skills, interview techniques and job seeker support \\ngroups.\" \\n Organization Information \\n \\nIn two or three paragraphs, tell the funder about your organization and why it can be \\ntrusted to use funds effectively. Briefly summarize your organization’s history. State your \\nmission, whom you serve and your track record of achievement. Clearly describe, or at \\nleast list, your programs. If your programs are many or complex, consider adding an \\norganization chart or other attachments that explain them. Describe your budget size, \\nwhere you are located and who runs the organization and does the work. Add other \\ndetails that build the credibility of your group. If other groups in your region work on the \\nsame issues, explain how they are different and how you collaborate with them, if you do. \\nEven if you have received funds from this grantmaker before, your introduction should be \\ncomplete. Funders sometimes hire outside reviewers who may not be familiar with your \\norganization. \\n Problem/Need/Situation Description \\n \\nThis is where you convince the funder that the issue you want to tackle is important and \\nshow that your organization is an expert on the issue. Here are some tips: \\n• \\nDon’t assume the funder knows much about your subject area. Most grantmaking \\nstaff people are generalists. They will probably know something about topics like \\nShakespeare, water pollution and HIV/AIDS, but you should not assume that they \\nare familiar with \"Troilus and Cressida,\" taconite disposal methods or Kaposi’s \\nsarcoma. If your topic is complex, you might add an informative article or suggest \\nsome background reading. \\n       \\n• \\nWhy is this situation important? To whom did your organization talk, or what \\nresearch did you do, to learn about the issue and decide how to tackle it? \\n       \\n• \\nDescribe the situation in both factual and human interest terms, if possible. \\nProviding good data demonstrates that your organization is expert in the field. If \\nthere are no good data on your issue, consider doing your own research study,'),\n",

Don’t draw a dark \\npicture of nuclear war, teen suicide and lethal air pollution if you are planning a \\nmodest neighborhood arts program for children. \\n       \\n• \\nDon’t describe the problem as the absence of your project. \"We don’t have \\nenough beds in our battered women’s shelter\" is not the problem. The problem is \\nincreased levels of domestic violence. More shelter beds is a solution.  \\n Work Plan/Specific Activities \\n \\nExplain what your organization plans to do about the problem. What are your overall \\ngoals? You might say: \\n\"The goals of this project are to increase the understanding among Minneapolis middle \\nschool students about the impact of smoking on their health, and to reduce the number of \\nstudents who smoke.\" \\nThen go on to give details, including: \\n• \\nWho is the target audience, and how will you involve them in the activity? \\nHow many people do you intend to serve? Some projects have two audiences: \\nthe direct participants (the musicians in the community band, the kids doing \\nsummer clean-up in the parks) and the indirect beneficiaries (the music lovers in \\nthe audience, the people who use the parks). If so, describe both. How will you \\nensure that people actually participate in the program? \\n      \\n• \\nWhat are you going to do? Describe the activities. Tell the funder about the \\nproject’s \"output,\" or how many \"units of service\" you intend to deliver over a \\nspecific time period: how many hours of nutrition counseling to how many \\npregnant women; how many HIV/AIDS hot-line calls answered by how many \\nvolunteers. Be sure you don’t promise an unrealistic level of service. \\n        \\n• \\nWhat project planning has already taken place?

Some funders ask for the project start date \\nand project end date. In general, a project can be said to start when you start \\nspending money on it. If the project is long, consider including a timeline. \\n       \\n• \\nWhere will the project take place?  \\nYou may not know the answers to all these questions when you submit your proposal. \\nBut the more you know, the better the proposal will look. Apply the \"mind\\'s eye test\" to \\nyour description. After reading it, could the reader close his eyes and imagine what he \\nwould see if he came into the room where your project is happening? Many project \\ndescriptions are too vague. \\nRemember: You can continue to submit updated information to foundation staff almost \\nuntil the date the board actually reviews the proposal. \\n Outcomes/Impact of Activities \\nTell the funder what impact your project will have — what will change about the \\nsituation as a result of your project. For example, your pregnancy nutrition counseling \\nprogram intends to increase the birth weights of your clients\\' babies. \\nThe impact of a project is sometimes hard to define. What is the intended impact of a \\nperformance of Beethoven’s \"Ninth Symphony,\" for example?   \\nImpact can be difficult to measure. The desired impact of a smoking cessation program is \\nclear, but the desired impact of a leadership program for teenagers may be ambiguous \\nand difficult to quantify.  \\nTo add to the difficulty, few nonprofits can prove conclusively that a given impact was \\ncaused directly by their project. Your clients’ babies may weigh more, but the cause may \\nnot be your nutrition program. Nevertheless, you must do the best job you can to define \\nyour intended impacts. \\nOther Funding \\n \\nHere the funder wants to know if other organizations have committed funds to the project \\nor been asked to do so. Few funders want to be the sole support of a project. (This may \\nnot be true if the project cost is very small — less than $5,000, for instance — or if a \\ncorporation is seeking public visibility by sponsoring the project.) Funders generally \\nexpect you to ask for support from more than one source. In this section, you can also \\ndescribe the in-kind contributions (goods or services instead of cash) that people are \\ngiving to the project. \\nFuture Funding \\nIf you continue this project in the future, how will it be supported?

Many funders see their niche as funding \\ninnovation: supporting new approaches to old problems or finding solutions to new \\nproblems.  \\nWhat the funder really wants to see is that you have a long-term vision and funding plan \\nfor the project, that the project is \"sustainable,\" especially if it is a new activity. If you \\ndon’t have such a plan, start thinking about it — if not for your funders then for the \\nsuccess of your project or organization. \\nEvaluation \\nHow will you know whether you achieved the desired impacts? If you have done a good \\njob of defining them, all you need to do here is describe the information you will gather \\nto tell you how close you came. Will you keep records of incoming hot-line calls? Will \\nyou call your counseling clients six months after they leave the program to ask how they \\nare doing? Explain who will gather the evaluation information and how you will use it. \\nBe sure your evaluation plan is achievable given your resources. If the evaluation will \\ncost money, be sure to put that cost in the project budget. \\nBudget \\n \\nHow much will the project cost? Attach a one- or two-page budget showing expected \\nexpenses and income for the project. Or you can use the budget format in the Minnesota \\nCommon Grant Application Form. \\nEXPENSES  \\nDivide the expense side into three sections:  \\n• \\nPersonnel Expenses  \\n• \\nDirect Project Expenses  \\n• \\nAdministrative or Overhead Expenses  \\nPersonnel Expenses include the expenses for all the people who will work on the \\nproject. They may be employees of your organization or independent contractors. If they \\nare employees, list the title, the annual pay rate and, if the person will be working less \\nthan full-time or less than 12 months on the project, the portion of time to be dedicated to \\nthe project.

It is an important mental process. Many of the mental processes, \\nlike imagination, learning and thinking are neither possible nor useful without \\nattention. It is difficult to think about anything unless we concentrate our \\nattention on it. Attention is a part of mental activity. \\n \\nIt was Wilhem Wundt, the father of modern psychology who introduced the \\nstudy of attention to the field of psychology. \\n \\nAttention \\nAttention is defined as the Act or state of applying the mind to something. It is \\nthe cognitive process of selectively concentrating on one thing or event by \\nignoring other things. \\n \\nAttention can be referred as a selection process. To attend to an external \\nevent like sound, image, smell... or internal thoughts we have to maintain a \\ncertain level of awareness. When we attend to one stimulus, it is seen that we \\nhave removed our attention from other stimuli. Our mind concentrates and \\nselects only one stimulus, which is best suited to it, for paying attention. \\n \\n \\n \\nIt has been noted that we pay more attention to stimuli that are meaningful or \\nemotionally significant. Our motivational states whether we are Hungry or \\nThirsty- play important roles in attention. Repeated exposure may also \\nincrease attention to particular stimuli. Example, Prenatal auditory exposure \\nexplains why a four day old infant listens to the mother’s voice by turning their \\nhead than to voice of other women. On the other hand exposure to constant \\nstimulus can lead to habituation. When we are living in a home near to forest, \\nfirst the sounds of birds and animals will be making us to attend to it often, but \\nafter a period of time we no longer perceive this voice. Our brain is adapted to \\nthis constant stimulus by turning it out. \\n \\nAttention is a process that “encodes language input, keeps it active in working \\nand short-term memory, and retrieves it from long-term memory” (Robinson, \\n2003, p. 631). Attention refers to focusing and processing information from \\nour surroundings. It involves the cognitive resources to focus on the object.  \\nAttention varies from one situation to another.'),\n",

One object is the focus \\nof attention. All other objects are in the margin of attention. \\n\\uf0b7 Attention is always changing. Attention is not a fixed state or power of \\nmind. It is an activity and cannot be centred round any one object for a \\nlong time. Even though we may attend to the same object, for some time, \\nAttention is shifted from one aspect of it to another. \\n\\uf0b7 Attention increases the clarity of the object. When we pay our attention to \\nan object we clearly perceive what it is. \\n\\uf0b7 Attention is selective. We may attend to one object in preference to others. \\nWe may not draw attention to everything that comes in its way. Those \\nobjects which have some special advantages can draw attention and \\nothers are ignored, even when we pay attention. \\n\\uf0b7 Attention is a state of preparedness where the muscles and sense organs \\nget ready themselves for taking in information from various stimuli. \\n\\uf0b7 Attention is cognitive, affective and conative. There are mainly three types \\nof mental activity-knowing, feeling and willing. We must attend to a \\nparticular thing at first in order to know, feel or act. Attention is common to \\nall these mental activities. The process of attention has all the three \\naspects of conscious life- knowing, feeling and willing. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Attention is a psychomotor response that brings stimulation from the object \\nwhich is in the focus of consciousness. When we listen to a lecture on the \\nplatform, we hear only the words of the speaker. We look at the platform \\nand sit on the edge of our seats. There is a motor attitude of tenseness \\nand also sense organ adjustments in retention. In case of visual attention, \\nthe eyes are focussed and directed which involve mental as well as motor \\nadjustments. \\n\\uf0b7 To attend to a particular thing means to be conscious of it more keenly and \\nintensely than anything else.'),\n",

One way of classifying attention is given below. \\n \\na) Selective attention \\nThe act of focussing on a particular object for a period of time while \\nsimultaneously ignoring irrelevant information that is also occurring is called \\nas selective attention. In this we block out certain features of our environment \\nand focus on one particular feature. This occurs in a daily basis. Even though \\nmany things occur in our daily life, we select stimuli which are important to us. \\nThe degree to which one can use selective attention varies depending on the \\nperson and his ability to focus or concentrate. The distractions in the \\nenvironment also affect Selective attention. Selective attention prevents us \\nfrom being flooded with extraneous information. Examples are listening to a \\nconversation in a noisy room, concentrating on the smell of the food than the \\nshows in the television, when we are hungry.  \\n \\nb) Divided attention \\nThis refers to paying attention to two things at a time. Talking over phone and \\ndoing cooking at the same time. It is the ability to process two or more stimuli \\nor react to two or more different acts simultaneously. It can be referred to as \\nmulti-tasking. Basically, it refers to dividing our attention between two or more \\ntasks. Even though this type of attention is thought of as the ability to focus on \\ntwo or more stimuli or activities at the same time, it is humanly impossible to \\nconcentrate completely on two different tasks simultaneously because usually \\nour brain can only process one task at a time. So we are really not “focused” \\non one task at a time, instead we are continuously alternating our attention \\nbetween tasks. That is why it is so difficult and dangerous to text and drive or \\ntalk and drive. It is difficult to maintain attention and it also reduces the ability \\nto remember. \\n \\nTo some extent we are able to use divided attention successfully because of \\nmuscle memory or habit.   It helps us to perform two or more tasks \\nsimultaneously such as reading music notes and playing instruments, talking \\nto a person while typing. However, in this situation we are really not focusing \\non hand positions when playing the instrument or concentrating on the \\nindividual acts of typing or driving. We are able to do the task without \\nconscious effort or actually paying attention. \\n \\nc) Sustained attention \\nIt is the ability to focus on one specific task for a longer period of time without \\nbeing distracted. i.e. to concentrate on a task, event or feature in our \\nenvironment for a prolonged period of time. For example, when people are \\ndoing painting on a canvas they work with it for many hours or days without \\nany distraction. This work goes on for a longer period. Listening to a lecture, \\nplaying video games, reading books are some of the examples of sustained \\nattention. Sustained attention is not always constant. It can be slightly \\nchallenging. It can vary from one task to another, moreover we may have a \\nsmall distraction while doing something for a longer period but the merit is that \\nwe can refocus on the same task. \\n \\nSustained attention is also related to attention span. It refers to continuously \\nfocusing on things happening rather than loosing focus. Practice can increase \\nthe span of attention. Attention span is our ability to keep our mind focused on \\nsomething through careful observing or listening. It can be just momentarily'),\n",

Attention span is a measure for \\nhow easily distracted a person is, and longer attention spans usually make it \\neasier for people to complete tasks and remain organized. A person’s \\nattention span also affects social interactions; some people struggle to remain \\nfocused on conversations without becoming distracted. \\n \\nA person’s attention span varies with context and the type of task. Some \\npeople are able to concentrate longer on certain kinds of tasks, such as \\ngames, reading, or conversations, than they can focus on other types of \\ntasks. Distraction-filled environments can decrease a person’s attention span. \\nPeople generally have shorter attention spans in loud, chaotic environments \\nor when they are emotionally disturbed. \\n \\n \\n \\nd) Executive attention \\nExecutive attention refers to the attention that we use when we are making \\nsteps towards a particular end. It is associated with the planning and working \\nto attain the goal and involves monitoring our progress in the act. It is used to \\ndescribe one of the main components of a person's working memory. \\nExecutive attention is characterized by the ability to effectively block outside \\ndistractions while focusing on a single object or task. This could be explained \\nwith an example. When children play by constructing a structure out of the \\ndifferent toys or blocks available, they have to attend to the important parts \\nneeded for the construction like building connections, colours and complete \\nthe structure, at the same time ignoring the irrelevant parts. They plan and \\nexecute the job. In this situation, the planned behaviour selectively enhances \\nthe attention to a particular aspect and inhibits attention to things that are \\nirrelevant. This type of executive functioning that guides the planned \\nbehaviour can be called as executive attention. \\n \\ne) Alternating attention \\nOne more type of attention can also be there namely alternating attention. In \\nthis type, we shift our focus of attention and move between different tasks \\nhaving different cognitive needs. This involves alternating our attention back \\nand forth between two different tasks that require the use of different areas \\nour brain. We often use this type of attention in our life.

This is known as \\ninvoluntary attention. For example, even though we may listen to a lecture \\nwith all interest, some loud noise outside the room may draw our attention \\ntowards it. \\n \\n2) Voluntary Attention: \\nWhen an individual divert his attention towards a particular activity or situation \\ndeliberately, may not be diverted spontaneously, but after some struggle, it \\ncan be referred to as voluntary attention. For example, while sitting in a class, \\nin order to pass the examination, the students divert their attention towards \\nthe lecture even if it is not interesting. \\n \\n \\n \\n3) Habitual Attention: \\nIn some situations, reaction to a stimulus or attending to a stimulus becomes \\na habit. So the individual will automatically divert his attention towards that \\nstimulus. For example, a person interested in music will automatically be \\ndiverted towards the sound of music even when he is busily engaged in \\ntalking to somebody. \\n \\nFactors affecting attention \\nThere are several factors that can affect attention. Each of these factors can \\nincrease or decrease a person’s attention to a certain object, person or \\nconcept. These could be classified under two broad categories namely \\nexternal factors and internal factors. \\n \\nExternal factors \\nFactors which are present outside the stimuli or situation refer to external \\nfactors. These can also be called as objective factors. This involves: motion, \\nsize, intensity, novelty, emotion, personal significance and social cues.'),\n",

(Ormrod, 2008).  Example: Children are \\nmore drawn to toys and objects that move such as toy cars, moving dolls. \\nb) Size: Size has an effect on attention. Objects or text that is larger gain \\nmore attention than normal or small objects. At the same time very small \\nobjects too draws our attention when compared to normal size. When a \\ndwarf man is seen, people will have a tendency to look at the person. \\nc) Intensity: Intense objects attract our attention. Loud sound, bright objects \\nand strong smell draws our attention easily. \\nd) Contrast: Anything that is different from its surroundings is contrast. A \\nblack dust in white sugar draws more attention \\ne) Novelty: New things attract people more. Students pay more attention to a \\nnew way of teaching or a new teacher. \"Stimuli that are novel or unusual \\ntend to draw people\\'s attention.\"  (Ormrod, 2008, p. 172) \\nf) Emotion: Words with strong emotional connections seem to gain more \\nattention than others. \\ng) Personal Significance:  A person is more likely to pay attention to a person \\nor concept that has a personal significance to them. Example: If a person \\nsuffers from a disease, they are more likely to pay attention to a lecture \\nabout that disease, because they know how it could affect their lives. \\nh) Social cues: “People are more likely to pay attention to things they see \\nothers looking at or reacting to (Ormrod, 2008, p. 173)”. Example: When \\nwe see a crowd of people looking at something we will also try to find out \\nwhat the group is reacting to, its Human curiosity. \\n \\nInternal factors \\nInternal factors are concerned with the individual. Hence it is also called as \\nsubjective factors. The factors are: \\n \\na) Interest: People always give more attention to stimuli or situation in which \\nthey are interested. Interesting things draws our attention immediately. A \\nSinger may give more attention to songs when he travels instead of the \\nbeautiful buildings on the way, whereas an Architect may show more \\nattention towards the Beautiful buildings. Attention and Interest are inter-\\nconnected and mutually dependent. They are like two sides of a coin. To \\npay attention to an object, a person or an activity is to have interest in \\nthem. Mc Dougall has very cogently said, “Interest is latent attention and \\nattention is interest in action.” The interest of a person plays a key role in \\ndetermining one’s attention. Each of our interests may be regarded as a \\npowerful stimulus to draw our attention to a particular thing, person or an \\nactivity.'),\n",

How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word?

This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG, and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel.

(2003) and Bengio et al. (2006) showed that\\nneural language models could also be used to develop embeddings as part of the task\\nof word prediction. Collobert and Weston (2007), Collobert and Weston (2008), and\\nCollobert et al. (2011) then demonstrated that embeddings could be used to represent\\nword meanings for a number of NLP tasks. Turian et al. (2010) compared the value\\nof different kinds of embeddings for different NLP tasks. Mikolov et al. (2011)\\nshowed that recurrent neural nets could be used as language models. The idea of\\nsimplifying the hidden layer of these neural net language models to create the skip-\\ngram (and also CBOW) algorithms was proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013a).

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures.

For example, when people are \\ndoing painting on a canvas they work with it for many hours or days without \\nany distraction. This work goes on for a longer period. Listening to a lecture, \\nplaying video games, reading books are some of the examples of sustained \\nattention. Sustained attention is not always constant. It can be slightly \\nchallenging. It can vary from one task to another, moreover we may have a \\nsmall distraction while doing something for a longer period but the merit is that \\nwe can refocus on the same task. \\n \\nSustained attention is also related to attention span. It refers to continuously',\n",

       " 'such as turning around after hearing a loud noise, or it may be for a sustained \\nperiod of time such as playing a video game.  Attention span is a measure for \\nhow easily distracted a person is, and longer attention spans usually make it \\neasier for people to complete tasks and remain organized. A person’s \\nattention span also affects social interactions; some people struggle to remain \\nfocused on conversations without becoming distracted. \\n \\nA person’s attention span varies with context and the type of task. Some \\npeople are able to concentrate longer on certain kinds of tasks, such as \\ngames, reading, or conversations, than they can focus on other types of \\ntasks. Distraction-filled environments can decrease a person’s attention span. \\nPeople generally have shorter attention spans in loud, chaotic environments \\nor when they are emotionally disturbed. \\n \\n \\n \\nd) Executive attention \\nExecutive attention refers to the attention that we use when we are making',\n",

This could be explained \\nwith an example. When children play by constructing a structure out of the \\ndifferent toys or blocks available, they have to attend to the important parts \\nneeded for the construction like building connections, colours and complete \\nthe structure, at the same time ignoring the irrelevant parts.

In \\nthis type, we shift our focus of attention and move between different tasks \\nhaving different cognitive needs. This involves alternating our attention back \\nand forth between two different tasks that require the use of different areas \\nour brain. We often use this type of attention in our life.

This is known as \\ninvoluntary attention. For example, even though we may listen to a lecture \\nwith all interest, some loud noise outside the room may draw our attention \\ntowards it. \\n \\n2) Voluntary Attention: \\nWhen an individual divert his attention towards a particular activity or situation \\ndeliberately, may not be diverted spontaneously, but after some struggle, it \\ncan be referred to as voluntary attention.

Example: Children are \\nmore drawn to toys and objects that move such as toy cars, moving dolls. \\nb) Size: Size has an effect on attention.

When a \\ndwarf man is seen, people will have a tendency to look at the person. \\nc) Intensity: Intense objects attract our attention. Loud sound, bright objects \\nand strong smell draws our attention easily. \\nd) Contrast: Anything that is different from its surroundings is contrast. A \\nblack dust in white sugar draws more attention \\ne) Novelty: New things attract people more.
